There is a limit to how much tunnel you can add because at some point if you have to do 20km down and up or left and right to get to a tunnel with no traffic and its not worth it anymore so there will be a hard limit on how many tunnel you can make to keep it interesting and that hard limit increases only if traffic gets worseThe problem is traffic not the number of lanes,0.684,0.2929,0.0231

Pretty much all of the ideals that Musk has mentioned or rather all of those that his cult followers have attributed to him will only last as long at twitter once they figure out which ones hurt the companys bottom line  100 human authentication and absolute free speech may sound great in principleuntil it starts eating in to profits  The reality of the free market is that the free market is going to do whatever makes it the most money  highminded ideals dont last so long in that environment,0.6635,0.3108,0.0257
The first comment was  Fairly obvious ideas for a comic book villain narcissistTwitter takeover for free speechElon Musk keeps tweeting that he loves free speech So heres a thread with just a few of the countless examples showing he couldnt care about it less Then theres the time Tesla asked China to censor comments that were critical of the company  bloombergcomnewsfeatures20210705teslasfallfromgraceinchinashowsperilsofbettingonbeijinghttpstwittercomJoshuaPotashstatus1519040404087320578Elon Mus,0.4359,0.5026,0.0615

Im not especially concerned about this From what Ive read Musk clearly hasnt thought very deeply about it His ideas are really simplistic and generally he doesnt get the stuff Jack had to get to make him pay attention When big celebrities start putting him on blast bc Alex Jones is sending mobs of antisemites and wackos threatening to murderrape them hell realize why Twitter is the way it is nowIdeas like positive free speech and negative free speech dont even seem to be in his vocabulary He doe,0.8293,0.1616,0.009
In a perfect world the SEC and the FCC wouldnt allow this acquisition because he manipulated the stock prices and would use twitter to signal boost his manipulations going forward with no oversightUnfortunately we live in a world where a man who thought you could inject bleach and use really bright lights to cure covid got 47 of the popular vote,0.7083,0.2732,0.0185

Seems like a good argument against censorship Because we dont want those in power to have the power to control the exchange of thoughts and ideas Its easy to support it when the subject of censorship is vile like hateful speech but its imperative that we test this idea by asking how we would feel about censorship if someone we vehemently disagree with and distrust had the censorship powers,0.2881,0.5687,0.1432

He wants to reverse the restriction of free speech on the platform And by that I mean he thinks its okay for politicians and business and news sources to just straight up lie to people Twitter was actually censoring false information by these figures and it seems like Musk is somehow against it,0.5355,0.4382,0.0263

I think were all getting wrapped up in the smoke screen of free speech Elon bought Twitter because of the commercial benefits He now owns data dating back as far as 2006 Your tweets are rich in behavioural data persona mapping brand affinity associations political affiliations public and private sexual proclivities etc and all of this is quantitatively measurable with engagement metrics location and interaction dataSimply put this data holds every one of our emotional triggers and motivators And,0.096,0.7711,0.1329

Because now its all on him and he might decide to do something like allow all kinds of hate speech or disinformation in the name of free speech,0.7961,0.1959,0.008
I think right now it is all an unknown  Musk is intelligent but he at times is also an erratic manchild  I feel like he blamed twitter for his issues with the SEC when it was his own comments and tweets that caused those issuesTwitter holds some importance because it is a communication tool for individuals politicians and businesses  It is the modern equivalent of what radio was almost a century ago,0.514,0.459,0.027
I think its because he says a lot about free speech but generally behaves in a petty and vindictive way when he is displeased with someone So its pretty easy to fear that speech might be just a little more free for those that dont disagree with ElonBesides even if he makes good on his promises anyone who has ever dealt with an online forum knows that unmoderated communities devolve into kooks and trolls ruining everything,0.7173,0.2671,0.0156

Listening to Musks remarks about free speech makes me wonder if he truly understands why social media platforms do some of the things they doFree speech is indeed a freedom and an important one  But like all freedoms it can be abused to become quite harmful  When one freedom starts to impinge on other freedoms then something needs to give and right now we are seeing those harms from deliberate misdisinformation campaigns that are threatening the very foundations of our society like democracy,0.6582,0.3266,0.0152

I think hes just saying its for free speech really hes trying to1 Control the media2 Make even more moneyOwning one of the biggest social media platforms gives you a ton of influence over the world Its also not going anywhere its going to make a ton of moneySure maybe Elon is going to give us all more free speech an edit button and just happily sit back while people on Twitter enjoy absolute freedom Or maybe hes going to use it to get even richer and shut down narratives that threaten him and hi,0.0573,0.4904,0.4524

Answer Is either massive deletion of bot accounts or people leaving twitter after Muskquisition Edit or both at the same time of course,0.279,0.6885,0.0325
Answer it is most likely due to removing of bots Twitter has been notorious for allowing bots to follow verified accounts that share their preferred narratives and agendas,0.3745,0.6028,0.0226
Answer There are 3 viable explanations for why this is happening1 Bot purge this is the most likely one2 Twitter bug it could be a bug in the code making people lose followers or displaying incorrect follower counts3 Elon Musk buying Twitter and people quitting This isnt all that unlikely in Mark Hammills case He has 5 million followers and lost less than 02 of those other two cases are similar They lost around 02 to 05 of their followers and its not unthinkable that 0205 of the Twitter users qu,0.5614,0.4211,0.0175
Answer Elon has stated he plans on taking the algorithm open source and the company private Neither of those actions suggest twitter will become more profitable as a platformElon has also stated that he wants to unblock everyone However I have a feeling that once he speaks to lawyers about letting people provoke violence his platform that stance may changeHe also wants to make all users verified which destroys the bot market I expect bots make up a good portion of users on all platforms,0.1765,0.7632,0.0602
Answer at least for Hamill its a tongue in cheek tweet to indirectly illustrate and possibly embellished for comedysatire that Musks stated operations standards for content permitted on Twitter has and will continue drive users to abandon the platform  their account Fans of Musk and Freeze Peach are mocking the threats of exodus as being analogous to the threats of Americans who warned theyd move to Canada if X happens And since Twitter will now be privately held the quarterly reports of operati,0.4316,0.5421,0.0263

His stances havent changed the politics haveMy current favorite idea to chew on every and I mean every reasonable progressive eventually becomes a conservative Why Because we as a society move in a progressive manner And every reasonable person sees their hopes and vision met at some point And it is at that point they realize they are happy with where we are at and they decide to conserve it,0.0731,0.6127,0.3142

I dont remember them vowing to end world hunger like Musk did,0.4813,0.4887,0.03
For what reason would any mega rich person stray from the standard diet of selfindulgence and conspicuous consumption,0.4008,0.5595,0.0397
Elon Musk was the only one who promised to do it and then reneged,0.3808,0.5687,0.0505
If you want to end world hunger youd be better off voting in some more progressive political leaders who would keep western resources companies from facilitating the looting of Africa and Asia  Countries like Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo have huge oil  gas and mineral wealth but its easier for western resource companies to pay billions into the overseas bank accounts  to the leaders than it is to ensure that the royalties stay in the countryIf the US UK and the Netherlands passed law,0.3302,0.5641,0.1056
What people need to realize about the very rich is that a vast number of them are psychopaths Thats not rhetoric or hyperbole psychopathy serves CEOs very well it makes it much easier to view people as numbers and to manipulate your way to the topEnd the cults of personality surrounding the very rich and politicians Worshipping these people serves nobody except the ones being worshipped,0.6668,0.2978,0.0355
To me Elon  just gave makes it sound like the former owners had incurred no previous cost for their ownership and that they have 44 billion of pure profit with which to go forth and do good thingsAnd I guess that the 44 billion is a one lumpsum homogeneous amount not that its spread across thousands  thousands of share holdersSo it seems a bit disingenuous and irritating but maybe I am just reading it wrong,0.1593,0.6556,0.1851
This is either like layers of misunderstanding or a really feeble attempt to mislead peopleAlso super weird how quickly people will trip over themselves to excuse Musks obviously problematic behavior even when the criticism is very specific to that behavior,0.8897,0.1043,0.006
Elon also still has 180 billion left after buying Twitter to ban the bot that tracks his personal jet So he can fucking end world hunger too the twat,0.749,0.213,0.038
Thats not how that works He is buying all the shares of the company so that none is spread among approx 850million shares owned by thousands of investment companies mutual funds retirement funds and individuals,0.26,0.7067,0.0332

Do people realize that the places they want some a few people to end hunger actually have governments that collect taxes receive ficial aid from WFP World Bank and other international organizations The first step to ending hunger is to hold people in those governments accountable before looking for some savior to use his billions to end world hunger,0.3078,0.6067,0.0854
If it only costs six billion dollars why hasnt the UN just got that from its member nations  I feel like the US spends that on 1 tank or something right,0.3365,0.6327,0.0307
You know what Forget the debating ending world hunger for just a second How about ending American hunger He could do that easy Im not saying fuck everyone else Im saying to those people who think world hunger is too big to solve with money he can absolutely do one country or at least help that he says he cares so much about But he doesnt Why He doesnt actually care He rather spend time making his own spacecraft for space tourism which wont be viable for even the mega rich until hes dead and gone,0.606,0.3221,0.0719
It certainly could be but human suffering is meaningless to him,0.8557,0.1326,0.0117
Is this a weird nerd defending Elon What a goober hahaha,0.7579,0.2156,0.0265
I think the problem is that Elon bitches about having to pay his fair share in taxes but has no problem forking over 44 billion to stroke and preserve his fragile ego,0.7302,0.2521,0.0177

Twitter in a nutshell,0.3426,0.5876,0.0698
Twitter is literal ass 989 of it is just teenagers and 20 somethings typing thoughts out that end up just being painfully cringe ridiculous and absolutely undeserving of being anywhere besides in the head they originally came from,0.9347,0.0594,0.0059
1 Self important influencer celeb or journalist proclaims they are quitting 2 Individual receives more engagement than they have in 2 years to said post3 Doesnt quit because they want to reply to echochamber replies and DMs Gets into a couple fights they cant back down from too4 Has change of heart to stay so they can use their platform to continue peddling illusion of their selfordained importance,0.3061,0.6027,0.0912

Funny that everyone was perfectly fine with China owning Tiktok and manipulating what everyone sees on there but put Elon musk in charge of Twitter and everyone goes absolutely nutsIts almost like people just get mad at whatever the media tells them to get mad at,0.7281,0.246,0.0258
MehI remember everyone that was moving to Canada when Cheeto man was running for president Like most of the movements we see theres a whole lot of talk and very little action,0.6497,0.3244,0.0259
Lmao nobody cares if they  their Twitter accounts but I bet any money they wont People are so addicted to social media that they cannot stop using it Its legitimately comparable to smoking cigarettes you dont technically have any physical withdrawal symptoms but youll go insane without it,0.7532,0.2019,0.0449
If Elon actually wants to make money for the banks foolishly loaning him 44b on Twitter hell make very few changes to the existing site formula and look for ways to better monetize itThe problem with making Twitter a platform for Free Speech by eliminating moderation which appears to be what he wants to do is that a bunch of other sites have already tried doing that exact thing and have failed to crack beyond niche players in the social media space 4chan had this idea back in 2003 Gab and Parler,0.4875,0.4601,0.0524
This is probably one of the most insignificant and meaningless articles I have read about this Nobody cares if you are coming or going from twitter If you dont want to be on twitter dont be on twitter Nobody is forcing you to stay Nobody is forcing you to go Manufacturing a crisis where there is none,0.8737,0.1188,0.0075
Twitter will always be absolute chaos but thats what happens when you give stupid people and smart people an equal platform for speech Plus 1000s of bots specifically made to push an agendaBut this is America and Ill never give up my right to free speech if I can help it so it is what it is Id rather have a full platform for free speech then to selectively choose what to censor PS It always best to just  all social media apps but look at me posting on a social media app This is the world,0.7462,0.226,0.0278

I mean if water would get into your vacuum tube it would be kinda fucked and not be able to do its job anyway So water ingress shouldnt be a problem at that point youll probably have to shut down the line and conduct repairs An earthquake howeverAnyway hyperloop is about as viable for mass transportation as maglevs There is a reason why Germany sold that tech they developed on it to China its simply to inefficient to be viable for anything other than being a prestige object,0.7528,0.2323,0.0149
Hyperloop tunnels would be sealed to maintain a vacuum and engineered to deal with ground water so technically he is right However the engineering plant used to maintain the vacuum might be susceptible to hurricanes if not rigorously engineeredThe problem with hyperloop is more that the faster you go the further apart each train or vehicle has to be and above a certain speed capacity thereby goes down Stopping distances are not linear with velocityThe constant obsession with speed is counterprod,0.281,0.678,0.041

Honestly my take on this If Elon decides to do anything at all and he probably will its either going to have no impact at all or be a disaster Either way when his failure happens after a long line of documented and well observed failures already He and his army of Thoughtless NPC Incels Will blame the left and transpeople Hohum,0.8181,0.1701,0.0118

So something Ive never understood from a practical standpoint is the claims that predatory short sellers like Citadel and co Via PFOF and their MM designation are  able to create fake shares essentially to artificially drive the price down are therefore going to be making money left and right But doesnt that imply the share prices of these equities are going down For the past 10 years most equities have been going up unless they time it perfectly,0.5654,0.416,0.0186

And in true Musk fashion he has clarified his stance to be mostly compatible with EUs reality check By free speech I simply mean that which matches the law I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law If people want less free speech they will ask government to pass laws to that effectTherefore going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people,0.0543,0.7251,0.2206

The only time I use Twitter is when I get free entries into a give away for reposting and tagging I see as much value in that as a used condom full of fire ants Why wouldnt he just make his own system I mean its not like the guy just buys whatever business vs really creating something new and different Ohoh waitI forgot who we were talking about for a second Never mind,0.2928,0.5757,0.1315

He doesnt have to change much just make sure enforcement was fair across the board The whole problem was people getting preferential treatment While others got the opposite depending on different factors If you say racism isnt allowed that includes the posts about white and Asian people and if that isnt enforced then clearly there is bias Thats just one example and it happens everywhere including reddit,0.5964,0.3818,0.0218

This isnt going to go well for trans Twitter Musk has some plan to authenticate Twitter users What does he mean by that Does he expect users to identify themselves using official ID Will users be forced to display their real names Anonymity is a matter of safety for trans folk so anything like that is going to result in an exodus from the site Maybe thats what Musk wants,0.8002,0.1926,0.0072
I have been wondering what to do about this  Leave Twitter now or wait until the antihate policies are formally rescindedThe only microblogging alternative I know of is Mastodon but that really needs a better newusers experience  And a good way to seek out people you used to follow on TwitterGranted the bigger problem  as youre saying  isnt that well be attacked while on Twitter its that haters will goad one another into more dramatic hate and eventually violence  Dont know what we can do about ,0.6021,0.3724,0.0255

The US government wasnt part of the decision making process for Musk buying Twitter that was up to the board of Twitter itself The SEC could theoretically jam up the works because of Musks missing his filing deadline caused him to essentially cause a run on stock that made him millions of dollars through irregular trading but our government doesnt really prosecute ficial crimes otherwise Trump never would have been able to run for president in the first place Twitter is one somewhat unimporta,0.571,0.4159,0.0131

I believe this was in reference to Elon asking how much it would cost to end hunger or something like that I believe the UN put a dollar amount on there and a subset of the internet got pissed because he made it seem like he would pay to end that problemIn reality I dont think musk is that great The right is fascinated with him because hes an edge lord when it comes to memes but they too will one day realize he doesnt actually care about them,0.5481,0.4141,0.0378

I think people have rightly criticized how he openly offers to help social issues and then does nothing while spending way more to acquire something for his own ego and control This dude told the UN hed pay 6B if they could provide a detailed plan for how to end world hunger for that cost They did He ghosted Dude said hed get Flint clean water sent bottles instead of dropping a few million on new pipes Hes all hat and no cowboy when it comes to shit that matters,0.7869,0.1995,0.0136

When they say they want Free Speech it usually means they want the ability to harass and misgender with impunity online I dont feel like Twitter even tried hard to curb it before musk but i feel like its gonna quickly make Twitter a worse place for everyone especially us ,0.8764,0.1169,0.0066
Get off the platform for your mental health Its going to get more toxic regardless of what he does simply because of the hype and rhetoric,0.8903,0.1032,0.0065
i think you should get off twitter asap,0.8923,0.1004,0.0073
When rightwingers say freespeech they mean consequencefree harassment Im not willingly going to be their punching bag so I d my account I think itll take a while but eventually nonmarginalized people will grow tired of the abuse and rightwingers will get bored with their selfcreated echo chamber and itll die out like MySpace and Facebook,0.8286,0.1622,0.0092
We have no idea at this time Hes only talked about verifying all humans and getting rid of bot swarms as well as making the algorithm open source so everyone can see itNo word on moderation solutions or on how to prevent harassment or if he believes that free speech means it must be heard by the person its directed at We know nothing except that Elon Musk loves to use alt right dog whistles and has offered to buy out plane tracking Twitter accounts he doesnt like His past behavior seems very ant,0.6323,0.3536,0.0141
I realize this qualifies as a hot take but I cant stress enough how much I mean it Twitter is going to be toxic no matter whoever owns it and the best thing you can do is just not be part of it just like Facebook Tik Tok etc Its not an i hate social media thing its a realization of why the fuck do i bother with this thing,0.8874,0.0993,0.0133

Unless Elon has some sort of brilliant plan for monetizing the company which he very well may I cant figure out why he cares so much Twitters business is so bad that it was worth more as a private company than a public oneIs Elon buying this crap company with no clear ficial upside simply because hes a bored billionaire whose ego wont let him stopWith the market down right now there are SO many other better companies to put money into,0.8781,0.1107,0.0112

Elon Musk has stated he wants all humans on Twitter to be verified with blue check and not just woke celebrities so that bots trying to create division are easily identified and banned This is a danger to democracy Also Elon Musk I hope that even my worst enemies stay on Twitter because that is what free speech meansWoah this man has to be stopped,0.7376,0.2346,0.0278

No it cannotMost developing nations have ineffective supply chains and rampant corruptionSolving those two would have a better impact than monetary donations,0.7504,0.2246,0.0249
It wouldnt For example the problem in Yemen is that Saudi Arabia wants the Yemeni people to starve They are using their military to ensure this happens They block food aid and they attack means of production to produce food In order to save the starving Yemeni people you need to go to war with Saudi Arabia and then win and then use the money to feed everyone which isnt going to happen The famine in Yemen is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world right now and its the easiest to explain Try N,0.8955,0.0982,0.0063
The simple answer is Supply Chain solutionsWe dump a lot of food that never even makes it off the shelf to rot,0.7766,0.2052,0.0182
Im sure this will get downvoted  Nobody ever talks about it but Musk donated 57 billion dollars to charities after the UN food program told him that is how much it would cost to end world hunger    They sent him a plan and Musk donated money accordingly Of course they changed their tune when it was pointed out that they themselves raised over 9 billion in one year and failed to stop world hunger The UN now say Musk saved 42 million from starvation,0.4005,0.54,0.0595
It doesnt lol,0.1658,0.6566,0.1777
World hunger and poverty are systemic problems Its not something easy as dumping money into it and it solves itself Poor countries tend to be very corrupt and undemocratic The only long term solution is to promote economic development and money can help with that if its managed properly,0.8191,0.1641,0.0168
The UNs plan was to end hunger for a year End of the year theyre back to square one again Cant blame Elon for seeing through that one,0.6345,0.3348,0.0307
Pretty sure those are the same people who would say that there are 300 million people in the United states so for only 300 million dollars everyone could have a million dollars  Also pretty sure Bill Gates has donated that much for addressing hunger at this point and yetstill have World hunger not saying Bill wastes his time doing that that is awesome,0.1327,0.4521,0.4152

I mean even if you buy the whole world a 66 billion dollar meal theyre just gonna get hungry again 6 hours later,0.5914,0.3716,0.037

It cant thats the problem Sure the man could certainly be putting his money to good work in the world and is deciding actively not to The bs about 6bn could solve world hunger Is a comical farce,0.7971,0.182,0.0209

If 66B could end world hunger a nation woudl have already done it 44b could end world hunger a nation would have already done it These arguements are empty pointless and compacted out of spite for elon based off misinformation campaigns The US alone spends trillions on pointless projects that are supposed to create healthy advancement progresses at home and around the world and fail to do so more often than not It has never been simple Fact of the matter is life is a bitch Literally speaking the,0.597,0.3572,0.0458

Theres a couple things you have to realise before it makes sense why its this way Most people dont actually watch interviews and listen to Musk speak Huge percentage have never even heard him talk beforeWhat they have heard is whats on in the news and what they see within their friends groups on social media and so they build up an image about him simply based on thatYou cannot change that in people  they need to want to seek the desire to listen and understand what hes doing So youll find it ex,0.5306,0.4491,0.0203
Tall poppy syndrome and hes outspoken and loves the limelight which will always invite disdainI reckon Green Goblin said it best Well to each his own I chose my path you chose the way of the hero And they found you amusing for a while the people of this city But the one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail fall die trying In spite of everything youve done for them eventually they will hate you Why bother,0.4198,0.4547,0.1255
I love Elon Im an investor in his companies and Twitter I want only the best for his efforts in expanding humanityHowever I would have preferred he not buy Twitter It is a big distraction and if he messes up it will only give FB more power  Twitter does need to be improved but I personally dont think he is the one to do it RegardlessElon is the man,0.0925,0.2226,0.6849

They hate rich people But they especially hate vocal ones that give their opinion,0.8532,0.1372,0.0096
Its because most of the people on Twitter like it there They like their echo chamber and feel that anyone with a different opinion should be blacklisted The kind that like to doxx people and weaponise posts from 10 years agoA bunch of people are hating it because Hell probably reinstate Donald Trumps account Theyre hating Elon because of something he MIGHT do Theyre scared of changeIf you support free speech then you got to be the kinder person and let them say they hate him We need to learn tha,0.7977,0.1883,0.014

The biggest reason is probably because both sides hate him He supports policies on both sides of the political spectrum an obvious example being that he supports UBI while also being an industrialist This makes him prime target for both sidesThe left hates him because hes a rich industrialist who expects his workers to dedicate their entire lives to their jobs and the right wing hates him because he believes in climate change and poses a big threat to traditional automotive and energy companiesI,0.7584,0.2214,0.0202

I dont think people realise but you can have free speech and limits on harassment These are two distinct things I think hes been more concerned about how people have been shut down due to misinformation which is a loosely defined term with too many caveats I personally see this as a win for society There isnt a popular platform that allows free and open conversations and dialogue as theyve been too concerned about their shareholders as opposed to the beginning overarching future of open dialogue,0.5086,0.4466,0.0447
If it goes through the private company can do whatever it wants and wont be beholden to shareholders Ultimately this will probably be a good thing for Twitter and free speech in general As a side note I wouldnt be surprised if Vine gets relaunched after the Twitter purchase It probably wouldnt be too hard to find a way to monetize things and make Twitter ficially stable,0.0245,0.3915,0.584

TWTR had a 45bi with ad revenue in 2021 check balance sheet against 115B of Meta and believe me 210B from Google Its a gold mine They are already incorporating Web3 into their applications and this trend is growing fast among many crypto projects The latest Polkadots parachain winners Equilibrium Unique Phala are closely related to Web3 Metaverse AI and ML develops follow the same way In addition to that the number of devs is growing exponentially,0.0038,0.077,0.9192

There are areas of Web3 that have amazing applications that could be revolutionary or destructive as well this is one of the destructive ones its an online return to the gold standard if used for spending as a fiat If not then its whatever and a cool new feature,0.1457,0.2858,0.5684
Elon is building a mafia and I dont know if such power in one mans hands is safe Props for chainge fice tho great feature and right timing Thanks for sharing,0.4484,0.3381,0.2135
Having Twitter on web3 I wonder what it would mean for the social media app i think there are more pressing issues like how to authenticate accounts something which can be solved by Alliance Block Trustless Identity Verification product,0.1925,0.7459,0.0616

thing that gets me is having all that money and still bothering with Twitter Like you could be on a super yacht off the amalfi coast but instead youre buying Twitter because youre convinced youve been shadowbanned from the timelines of everyone except fellow megavirgins,0.8292,0.1576,0.0132

The whole reaction to this is honestly fascinatingFirst of all Last election Elon musk endorsed Andrew yang A democrat He has never endorsed trump He shits on Bernie Sanders a lot Make of that what you will But people acting out like hes a trump mega fan is hilarious People say mainstream media influence is dying when in reality it picks what people careget angry about stillCan I ask this to all you guys here Why do you think there was none of the media outrage and no posts here when Jeff Bezosa,0.4658,0.4388,0.0953

Couldnt be less arsed personally Twitter is a shit show People act like Twitter hasnt given a platform for people like Trump for years and still do for other leaders and countries like RussiaHe cant make it any worse The hysteria coming from the user base mainly the Americans is insane Im pretty sure Musk supported the Democrats in the last elections if youre arsed about that although I dont know why you would be,0.9183,0.0725,0.0092

Musk is an American oligarch stealing money from the state and pretending hes a business guru So poor he cant pay taxes and relies on government assistance but so rich he can buy twitter outright,0.7886,0.1903,0.0211
Awesome I think thats great and expect to see the cesspit of Twitter sorted out now Looking forward to the open source algorithms so we can analyse and possibly stop the hatecults that have formed across society globally empowered by Twitter  its so unhealthy the culture that has formed out of Twitter just hatemobs everywhere on the platformJust to have a tinfoil moment though Mans got the metadata for his neurolink you think thats air your breathingEdit Also crypto adoption ,0.1983,0.2005,0.6011
Things will absolutely without a doubt change Twitter is a stagt company and essentially has been since its inception The reputation is that their engineers basically sit around and do nothing The stock price has done pretty much fuck all since it went public almost a decade ago Theres been zero innovation Their ad tech is really bad given how long the company has been around They still have a ridiculously bad bot problem and its kinda astounding that they havent developed a better solution t,0.9265,0.0665,0.007

As someone who worked at Tesla anyone who works at any company ran by him has an extremely high chance of being severely disappointed and worked to death The work is built to such a point that any and all human functions are regulated to assembly line procedures in order to meet the high publicized demand as he is a numbers man and is focused on results first with little regard for casualties sustained and a burnt out workforce Not to mention the mental health factor and the pay The pay can be g,0.8242,0.1567,0.019

Lol do all Elon companies still have Must be willing to work overtime and weekends on their applications I mean that alone should tell you,0.1502,0.6995,0.1503
The company is probably headed downhill in a big way Theres a reason he went for ownership instead of being on the board That reason is fiduciary responsibility If he went against that responsibility while he was on the board he could have been held legally liable He wants to do a bunch of stuff that will most likely damage the company for the sake of his ideology and ego and doesnt want the liability Also everything he directly works on ends poorly His management of Teslas autonomous vehicle pr,0.8452,0.148,0.0069
i mean musks companies tend to be or at least try to be on the cutting edge of an industry EV rockets etc twitter isnt the cutting edge of anything,0.3375,0.6085,0.0541
based on what Ive heard from current and farmer tesla employees I would brush up my resume if he takes control That is if he doesnt fire you first,0.1432,0.7677,0.0891
I wouldnt trust working for any company owned by MuskI work in aerospace Im more aware of the shit going on at SpaceX more than most at a minimum Going to take a hard pass on any CEO that thinks overworking their employees to the point of breaking is at all a good way to do business,0.8924,0.0968,0.0108
A lot of big RSUs are going to be paid out which means a lot of golden handcuffs are coming off Therell be a small exodus before the ink dries,0.164,0.6817,0.1543
I might be in a good position to answer this  I know multiple people that have worked and interned for different engineering orgs within Tesla across Sunnyvale Palo Alto and Fremont  Although it varies by team about half the teams seem to have surges of overtime work  Elons lack of discipline runs throughout the company so priorities can shift quickly and sometimes by tweet  Some teams are very close to him which is a lot of pressure to keep up with his whims  Retention is also poor  In the mids,0.2577,0.6784,0.0639
I have no stake in Twitter whatsoever including potential changes to working conditions I just want to say fuck Elon Musk,0.8797,0.1068,0.0135
Having friends at a Elon run company the working conditions are as described by others here Elon wants it fast cheap and thinks he knows everything That can backfire literally when you deal with things like you know a controlled explosion The big thing I want to add here is that there is an issue with racism sexism etc in Elon run companies Example visible minorities have issues with promotion etc,0.4609,0.4953,0.0437
I expect a lot of people will quit and I think thatll facilitate a change in work culture Like others have mentioned Im not sure that twitter didnt need a bit of shake up but Im not sure that itll be a super desirable place to work for any but Muskovites,0.5504,0.4139,0.0357
I imagine its going to suck as a platform and as a work place Not that Twitter was some magnificent platform it was slightly better than Facebook imo but its just going to go back to where it was in 2020 before they started banning all of the disinformation and be a giant cesspool of shit That coupled with terrible work culture and most of the left leaning hating Elon I would imagine the user base is going to dwindle and the workforce will as well based on how terrible he treats his employees,0.903,0.084,0.013
I know the corporate culture was super woke internally and put a lot of emphasis on diversity and things of that nature Id imagine that is likely to changeNo clue about working hours although he did make some jokes about nobody ever being at Twitter HQ because everyone works from home,0.3687,0.5792,0.0521
He expects everyone to work as hard as he does but with 110000000000000 000000000 percent of the pay,0.4624,0.4537,0.0839
I think they will get worse Elon is known to demand his employees give their life to the company and work insane hours I fully expect that to happen at twitter,0.7843,0.1945,0.0212
One of my biggest grievances with this take over is he hasnt said anything remotely close to the topic here I want to know exactly what he is going to change Shit posting on twitter about vague concepts or things that dont even make sense put the algorithm on github what doesnt do anything except make noise,0.9181,0.0763,0.0055

A rich guy who decides to take over an existing social media company after so many other free speech populist alternatives fail to gain any ground kinda suggests to me that someone thought taking over an existing social network might work better than trying to build a disadvantaged competitor    Then again maybe it is just all about him having free speech,0.4147,0.5307,0.0547

I hate twitter never signed up but might do just to bolster Musks numbers and prove a point,0.8656,0.1197,0.0147
I get the strange feeling that bots that atrificially inflate Leftists are switching sides so if any investigation is done then it will blow up in the Rights face as it proves Twitter had a Right bias That or so they can suddenly drop all of the bots and make it appear as though Twitter is haemorrhaging users and Elon is to blameEither way I think it may be a setup or hit piece Maybe its just the pessimist in me,0.6789,0.3093,0.0118

I was just reading the rtechnology thread on this and already seen so many people in panic because OH MY GOD HES GONNA LET TRUMP BACK ON THE SITE as if thats the worst thing to happen since Hitler Some people are just so fucked in the head Im not sure why people are freaking over Musk buying Twitter but I do hope he allows for more freedom of speech because its very clear what kinda agenda Twitter has as of right now Also if he did ban all Anime PFPs on Twitter that would be INCREDIBLY based,0.8727,0.1159,0.0114
IF this actually goes through and isnt blocked at the last second with some nonsense technicality and IF Elon actually keeps his promises then this is in my opinion THE most significant defeat woke authoritarianism has suffered since the start of the culture warHaving one of the major big tech platforms fully reset its rules back to the free speech social libertarian ethos of the early internet is HUGE  Simply the ability to push back against SJWs on twitter without having to treat them with kid,0.2994,0.4902,0.2104
When it first goes through it will be fun to throw the Its a private company it can do what it wants in the faces of all the people bitchingThat said it still remains to be seen what Musk will actually do Hes a billionaire which makes him completely untrustworthy He could simply have a hard on for free speech and want to push twitter back to more how it was in the early 10s or so which would be a great thing He could however just be doing shitty billionaire things because he thinks he can levera,0.3983,0.5027,0.099

Submission StatementWhen Elon Musk tweeted that he would authenticate all real humans he revealed his true purpose with the Twitter acquisition to remove anonymityAs Western governments become more totalitarian in nature it becomes increasingly important to have the option of anonymous communication One example is a citizen who wishes to criticize corrupt government without penalty After all we know the US Government is actively tracking the behavior of citizens online Yahoo Newshttpsnewsyahooco,0.0934,0.8151,0.0915

I literally just came to post this Say goodbye to your anonymized accounts Sock puppets will be banned as bots Good way to control speech and chill criticism of powerful people,0.845,0.1365,0.0185
It looks like he wants to do two things 1 Eliminate bots that falsely amplify certain opinions 2 Give people the opportunity to have their accounts verified in their own names Basically give anyone a blue check if they confirm their identity Its possible he wants to also rid the site of anonymous accounts but nothing hes said so far leads me to that conclusion,0.1148,0.8094,0.0758

Meat in the form of fish and other seafood is easier to do and the water can be used for growing plants as well A symbiotic relationship of fish and plants Protein from seafood plants provide veggies and greens for salads and balanced diet And water can be stripped for hydrogen to power fuel cells and of course the byproduct is oxygen molecules for atmosphere and fuels Much more feasible And self suffecient,0.0072,0.1918,0.801

My other big idea use a captured asteroid to live in Hollow it out by mining the metals that make up most asterpids and seal the thing inside with spray foam to seal it tight Give it a spin to induce gravity maybe 3 or so maybe more and now you have a habitat Plus the metal in the part of asteroid left acts as a radiation shield and insulation from impacts Add some kind of fission or fusion drives to it and you have a colony ship Steering and other parts necesary for travel could be worked out G,0.0384,0.7387,0.2229

Musk is certainly a troll and dips into internet culture quite a bit so hes very controversial But overall I think hes a strong force for good His companies are mostly awesome Tesla SpaceX Starlink Boring Company is probably not that realistic and Im not certain what will happen with Twitter but I hope for the best Hes a little crazy but Id expect as much from someone who takes such risks Not a fangirl these are just my thoughts on him,0.0808,0.264,0.6553

I would be extremely tentatively supportive of a reform to section 230 If it was sponsored directly by Rand Paul Justin Amash and directly supported by the Libertarian Party I would happily hear it out and see if it was going to maximize liberty without just being a way to give government control over social media Its an issue Im not sold on but Id be willing to hear out their proposalIf its being pushed by the politicians who only seemed to care about the problems with social media the moment i,0.0231,0.3514,0.6255

On the subject of Blackrock buying homes by the 10s of thousandsWe really need cascading tax regulations on corporate and household residential property ownership We need to make it ficially impractical for companies to use home ownership as a safe haven for liquid Its one thing if a company is building homes then selling them A company like Blackrock buying hundreds of thousands of homes is no benefit to the middle class it just makes the rich even richer Nothing wrong with a household that ,0.5291,0.4402,0.0307
