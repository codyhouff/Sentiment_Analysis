2,I hope he buys it just for it to become the MySpace,6838
3,,5503
4,,5411
5,Why do I get the feeling peoples expectations on the changes this brings are too high I doubt its going to be a free for all Thats a lot of money to risk,4145
6,Was going to comment about how Twitter is going to become a gigantic pump and dump playground while politicians rile their base into a frenzy with minimal oversight but this is already what twitter is,3993
7,I really dont care what he does or does not do with Twitter But we can dispel with any myth that an incredibly vain billionaire is spending 45 billion dollars on a social media platform for altruistic reasons or to improve it for everyone,3681
8,Ill offer 46 billion,3332
9,Hes going to ban that kid tracking his flights isnt he,3093
10,Good ol homeless not like the other rich people Elon Musk bids 45 billion to buy company,2565
11,Oh god hes gonna let trump back on,1789
12,We dont have to use it Just a suggestion,980
13,Twitter has value but its a really shaky companyYou have only a couple of types of users1 The user that has been on Twitter and has a bunch of ghost followers They have a million followers but their posts get a thousand interactions2 The dopamine addict3 The lurker4 Bots,967
14,d,812
15,Will Elon then allow to tweet about unionization efforts in Tesla factories,744
16,Extremely misleading title They are reconsidering it They arent to accept itEdit at the time that this article was posted it was true that that Twitter had not yet accepted this deal and that they were merely reconsidering the offer My comment still stands and news outlets should be held accountable for how they report things and not jump to conclusions,600
17,I still to this day do not understand Twitter  I tried like 3 times over the years to get into it and the appeal of this platform still escapes me,569
18,Oh cool  Elon and Jeff Bezos will be the prime sources for a lot of news in the world  What could possibly go wrong,514
19,Actual headline Twitter expected to accept Elon Musks bid to buy companyPost title is misleading and deceptive,419
20,Hes going to do all of this without having to sell shares of Tesla and pay taxes This shit should be fucking criminal,389
0,Bill Gates short position not looking bad now,16682
1,Tesla shareholders are anticipating that they will be on the hook for bailing out Musk for the Twitter purchase just like they were for SolarCity,10171
2,Tesla shares plummet to values not seen since last week,7959
3,Can someone explain to me why Tesla share holders would care if he buys Twitter Im not even being sarcastic or anything I genuinely dont get it,2657
4,The entire market tanked today,1357
5,Hes buying Twitter but yet Im still waiting on my vehicle and solar panels after 3 years,1269
6,rtechnology is now relonmusk,1163
7,And the biggest winner isBill Gates with his massive 500M short at 1200 per share to now 87642  135241667 gainEdit There was a thread a couple days ago on WSB I believe saying his short was at 1200 I stand corrected that it was in the 500 rangeHowever old Bill is still the big winner so far because hes not quite as fucked as he used to be on this one,632
8,Maybe smarter people knows how to make Twitter useful for Elon and the things he got going on For me its a dumb purchase as a Tesla shareholder,493
9,Elon said from the beginning not to invest in Tesla if youre looking for a safe return,297
10,Came for the rage stayed for the name callingPhony Stark is my new favourite  nickname for Elon Musk,265
11,I misreadmisunderstood the headline and totally changed it into a very puzzling concept  Why would Tesla share a sink,247
12,We shouldnt care about a billionaire EVER Something is wrong with Americans for idolizing a billionaire I hope this ruins Elon the great,168
13,Does he have any business people around him or are all these fly by the seat of his pants decisions,137
14,125 billion dollars lost because Tesla shared a sink,114
15,Looking forward to seeing how Elon abuses his Twitter admin powers,109
16,Its still overvalued By a lot,91
17,i mean Tesla is insanely overvalued mainly because of retail traders who are part of Musks cult of personality,84
18,I hate when people who dont understand stocks talk about the stock marketI dont know if anyone here has noticed but the market has been on a downward trend for a while now and yesterday was also a massive red dayTesla is also valued extremely high and is now only back to the same price it was at literally a month ago 125 billion is not that much in terms of Tesla market capAll that being said I wouldnt touch TSLA with a 10ft pole but then I guess I lost out on massive gains a few years ago so maybe Im the dumb one and we should all be loading up,55
19,Classic reddit make post on one day of trading about how billions were wiped not understanding marketcap,48
20,Everything dropped today,48
0,Guess whos banned now,1127

8,Im so tired of hearing about a billionaire man child,71
9,rbrandnewsentence,60
10,Muskiah,58
11,So many of these people would suck Elon dry in front of their family Then schedule another session for when hes recovered,49
12,Fuck musk,47
13,Or he takes over as CEO then is banned for shitposting  That would make him closer to shitposting Lucifer,32
14,,32
15,That would be beautiful,27
16,Because the muskrats dont treat him like a deity already,23
17,Elon is cringe,12
18,Elon Musk is not your friend,16
19,I think Elon Musk will be more like the devil to be honest,11
20,Or you know he can just fuck off,12
0,Id like to never have to hear the word influencer again,17999
1,Maybe he wants to YouTubize Twitter Work with influencers monetize their tweets in order to pull them in from other platforms Then take a  on some form of Ads he will manage to implement on tweets,4508
2,Influencers are what makes social media suck so much  Dudes rolling into this with rose tinted glasses and blinders,3489
3,There was an article in NYTimes I believe that basically said that Musk needs to pay off a 14B dollar loan to make this purchase fly That worked out to laying off 1400 of 7500 employees to bring up the income per employee numbers The writing is on the wall      Update FYI the source was not NYT Look herehttpsthetriadthebulwarkcompthetwitterbloodbathiscomingtokeneyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNjM0MTYzNiwiXyI6ImdOR21DIiwiaWF0IjoxNjUxMjUzMDAwLCJleHAiOjE2NTEyNTY2MDAsImlzcyI6InB1Yi04NzI3NCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ3to3K5GUwGk40Dl2d849xusJzjbEw9sb9KTPBRHzPksr   The bulwark The Twitter Bloodbath Is ComingAnd it wont have much to do with free speechJonathan V LastApr 27,1556
4,Hear me out for a sec it could be that Elon has no fucking idea what hes doing,1362
5,Oh ok so hes going to amplify a few profitable voices at the expense of everyone else  In the name of free speech right  Just about as free as Fox News or CNN with its pundits just another platform for a few loud voices to drown out all of everyone else and any original thought  How boring,1172
6,I mean he basically is an influencer so that figures,952
7,Less moderation and more influencersThats gonna be a dumpster fire,784
8,I was told that Elon didnt need Twitter to make money and could run it at a loss to promote true free speech Lol,671
9,The dude who is being worshipped as the hero of free speech is getting ready to create paid speech lolEdit didnt want to add on but you guys have to read the muskrat responses they are golden and listed at the bottom redditcomrtechnologycommentsuej4dbelonmusksuggestedfiringworkersandworkingi6oenme,438
10,Good if he destroys twitter he will be my hero,404
11,free speech is a monthly fee now,241
12,We are all just peasants the rich and powerful are royalty and the influencers are the court jesters The peasants and jesters are disposable,159
13,Its ok a year from now Twitter will be as popular as truth social,118
14,I didnt think I could detest him any more than I already do but here we are,102
15,Same thing he did at Tesla solar You cant speak with anyone just leave messages and a month or two or three somebody might return your call No salespeople no sales offices no service and support peopleoffices Its obviously different type of biz one you buy a product in the other theres really no product to sell but yourself But the tactic is similar firedownsize salaried support peopleEdit Im in favor of him buying Twitter and evening out the playing field Im just pointing out this is not exactly a genius idea Buy a company and fire people to cut costs Hohum,100
16,Firing workers to increase revenue  boy havent seen that tactic before from a greedy asshole billionaire s,101
17,Ahhh and the truth is finally laid bare Its not about free speech Its abount having a bigger horde than the other guys Thats all people like musk ever see huh Take something that already insanely profitable then turn it up to 11 to get even more money out at the expense of everything elseEdit could also be argued that you just wont get the kind of financing he asked for without putting forth some sort of profitability increase plan I get that Still if the concern is really with free speech then he should be advocate for a publicly funded internet instead of this corpo controlled profit driven technodystopian nightmare we currently have,97
18,My god Musk is so out of touch with reality Hes gonna be left holding a big bag of worthless twitter stock in about a year or so,84
19,Yeah what could go wrongWell hes about to find out,71
20,So the guy famous for being an asshole is being an asshole colour me shocked,71
0,Whoa Thats eeevil,1067
1,Do you know how much time it took to come up with that,595
2,Grimes is no Ramona Flowers but Elon definitely has a Gideon quality to him,590
3,You made me swallow my gum,179
4,Reference,109
5,Or Grimey as she liked to be called,103
6,Yall out here acting like Grimes wasnt out of her fucking mind already,85
7,omg i love this film,64
8,Elon wished he had that much hair,49
9,Theres just something about that Ramona Flowers,45
10,Save it youre pretentious this club sucks ive got beef lets do it,29
11,Thats not the only thing he implanted in her,27
12,Scott Pilgrim was a masterclass in how to bring mangaanime characters to the big screen Someone should strap M Night Shamalamadingdong in a chair and make him watch it over and over until he learns his lesson,24
13,Cant be Elon too much hair,13
14,This is literally the premise for Made for Love on HBO PremiseAfter a woman escapes from a suffocating 10year marriage to a tech billionaire she discovers her husband had her fitted with a tracking device The device which he implanted in her brain allows him to track her location watch her live and know her emotional data as she tries to regain her independence,13
15,Can everyone make a collective decision to stop talking about this guy,10
16,She saw Ramona Flowers and felt so empowered,6
17,Listen Kung pao chicken ,5
18,Oh hey i understand this reference,4
19,SCOTT PILGRIM REFERENCE,4
20,Play Cyberpunk 2077 and it feels close to reality her voicing a robot popstar,3
0,That kid that tracks the flights should have taken the deal,12301
1,Really amazes me how Twitter and Facebook have made people feel like these sites are permanently embedded their everyday existence and not just commercial products they could ditch in a heartbeat,6080
2,If this goes through Id like to see Twitter turn into a MySpace like ghost town,5230
3,This is pretty scary when you think about it Here we have one person buying up an entire platform because they are butthurt that a private company dares to enforce its terms of service This is why billionaires are dangerous and bad for society,5048
4,If they were going to sell to him anyway then what was the point of that socalled poison pill they enacted,4979
5,Now he can finally accomplish his longterm goal of calling whoever he wants a pedo,4328
6,Well this is akin to Rupert Murdochs 1976 deal for the New York Post and 2007 purchase of the Wall Street Journal The worlds richest person who has said he doesnt care about the economics of buying of Twitter is aiming to acquire a different kind of power control one of the worlds largest megaphones and the ability to impose his libertarian ideology on questions of moderation and misinformationOnly hes not a fucking libertarian considering he doesnt believe in free speech he blocked numerous people criticizing his business models of anti Union behavior and just people in general who disagree with him loves government handouts and profits off an infrastructure he doesnt pay for Hes another authoritarian who is trying to put his already heavy hand on the scales and remove the ability to have free speech,3659
7,Buying a social media platform for 45 billionWhat could go wrong,3128
8,Im more surprised Bezos hasnt tried to buy it before ElonHe really likes to keep his workforce quiet and disgruntled and Twitter really helped with the formation of these Amazon unions,3106
9,So trump will be back on Twitter,2623
10,They had no choice at the time the offer was made it was a 30 premium over of the current share price The board could be sued if the dont act the best interest of shareholders,2205
11,Everyone is gonna miss seeing posts about Tesla unionizing because theyre gonna be gone,2027
12,Its been a while since we had a site that big die  Was Tumblr the last oneBe interesting to see what kind of changes are made and if the site survives them  The internet used to be a fickle mistress changing popular sites on a whim but we seem to be much more established these days with the big dogs never really going away,1521
13,So much for paper billionare arguments that they dont have access to all their money Elon out here droppin a cool 46 bil on fuckin twitterFunfact if you had a awesome job and made 350000 a year and had zero expenses it would take you 2857 years to earn ONE billion,1286
14,Elon Musks wife left him for a trans woman Musk reacted with a transphobic meme on Twitter He received pushback This is his revenge In his effort to promote free speech Musk will turn Twitter into 4chan a site only Nazis and trolls will useEdit Musk is not a defender of free speechhttpstwittercomthelincolnstatus1518609128796696576s21tjaOaoLMqSQ2PKjfJS6fwEdit 2 Elon Muskhttpstwittercombnonewsstatus1518632272395657218s21tCA3o7iQ7FIHyu1uPEejhg someone who inherited his wealth from an apartheidera South African emerald mine now owns Twitter,881
15,So Twitter is about to become even more of a cesspool At what point do people accept that fact that building a society based on catering exclusively to the wealthy at the expense of everyone else isnt sustainable,650
16,Musk is using 21 Billion in cash Can we  please finally put to rest the idea that billionaires dont actually have liquid funds available     It seems like every freaking post on reddit has people commenting omg you dumb redditor think billionaires have billions in cash thats not how things work you stupid idiots,622
17,This means Trump is coming back to Twitter,606
18,Greeat Cant wait to see reddit spammed even more with his narcissistic little tweets,544
19,If the Twitter servers were turned off tomorrow the entire world would be a better place,508
20,No single human being should be allowed to hold that much direct power over the global discourse PeriodPeople have been talking about the democratizing power of the internet for about thirty years but this will stand as perhaps the single biggest antidemocratic development of the digital era,482
0,Actual nonclickbait title EU reiterates that the same laws still apply when pressed for answer by businessinsider Journalist,9923
1,He already said Twitter would abide by the laws of different countries just that they wouldnt go much beyond that,3868
2,I believe Musk stated that itll be moderated within the legal limits of free speech in the US which is not limitless There are already sites that operate within a similar framework far be it most are fairly shit and theyre not banned in the EU I dont think even Gab or Parler are,1583
3,I wonder how many billions he is going to lose on this ego trip,576
4,I am honestly shocked at the number of people who believe that free speech means anything goes Grow up please,296
5,4chan isnt banned in Europe so Im sure Twitter is fine,290
6,Ban twitter Dont threaten me with a good time,279
7,I dont want my government to protect me from websites,235
8,Censorship is the devil shocking to me how many people here support it,205
9,BREAKING  Elon Musk raises 248 trillion to acquire Europe,154
10,Hes repeatedly said that it needs to operate within the bounds of the law,110
11,Oh my god Im sick of seeing stuff about Twitter,97
12,Can anyone ELI5 why this guy buying twitter making this much news Implications etc,99
13,When you buy a bar but forget about liquor licenses,88
14,He said Twitters board will have to meet Europes laws on issues including moderation transparency and hate speechx200BInteresting how Twatter wasnt already being fined then,74
15,,76
16,I hate Twitter but banning it Are there other unmoderated social media platforms banned in Europe right now,68
17,If that ban is implemented worldwide it would be even better,48
18,,51
19,Authoritarians mad,45
20,I am all for banning twitter facebook and the like the social destruction they cause is terrible,49
0,This planet is getting weird,12282
1,its one big club and you aint in it,6906
2,Elon isnt interested in saving the world Hes interested in being the guy who gets the credit for saving the world,5799
3,Well just have to see whose rocket is bigger,5571
4,Imagine just having that conversation with someone hey bro you still have that 500 million position in Tesla,5271
5,What price You think he did it at 1200 a share,2652
6,Bill gates cant give his money away fast enough Half a billy anit shit to him,2354
7,This is better entertain than standup comedy,1714
8,Bill gates has diamond hands if I dont sell I dont lose attitude ,1641
9,The bull sized balls on that guy,1367
10,Actually Zoom is probably doing more than Tesla at this point,1204
11,Is he an idiot The fact that a company is helping fight global warming doesnt mean its not overpriced,1103
12,Cant wait to see Bills loss porn,954
13,Wtf I thought this was a shitpost ,660
14,Plz let this be real ,608
15,How is tesla doing most to fight climate changeThis guy is lying to himself,400
16,do billionaires actually text like this lmfao,389
17,The richest man in the world politely telling the former richest man to fuck off,376
18,More importantly than anything is that Bill Gates doesnt use an iPhone,351
19,I can see why twitter is a big deal to him,324
20,Uh if Bill is short on Tesla it doesnt mean that he hates them it means he doesnt expect them to do well I dont know how well known Gates relationship with Warren Buffet is but they are like really really tight  All I mean by that is Im sure he uses Warrenlike logic when investing So maybe Gates had reason to believe Tesla wouldnt do well And also half a billion isnt a lot to Bill Gates So dont act like hes hell bent against your convertible launching cult leader Also Teslas image is about luxury not environmentalism,324
0,bezos asked elon the same thing right how is he gonna comply with countries content policies and censorship,6292
1,This just in Musk buys the EU,3307
2,Always makes me laugh when Americans think the 1st amendment is somehow a global lawIts not and the majority of the planet recognizes that if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant then the tolerant will be destroyed and tolerance with themEdit This is a lot of brigading for a tech subEdit 2 Thanks for all the reports and concern about my mental health guys,2606
3,What are the actual implications if Twitter is banned in a country Id have to imagine people would still use the site eg YouTube is banned in China but Im sure people still use it,2476
4,Everyones freaking out but Im willing to bet Twitter will barely change at all,1948
5,the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debatedSo Twitter is what a debate is supposed to look like Guess Ive been doing it wrong,1284
6,There are American companies that choose not to operate in Europe rather than comply with EU law For instance there are several news outlets that rather than complying with GDPR they simply geoblock EU IP addressesThe EU is known for applying fines up to 10 of global revenues when companies break EU laws I am not concerned that twitter will break EU law,993
7,respect EU residents rights and EU laws or leave EULets see who has more to loseFacebook threatened EU to leave and just look how the whole region reacted,351
8,,303
9,Anyone think Twitter will be valued anywhere near as high as 44b in a year Because I dont,286
10,People really asking is twitter going to be toxic now like its not the most toxic social media platform to ever exist,237
11,Twitter is a bathroom wall why would I write my thoughts on a bathroom wall  Dave ChappelleEdit corrected spelling,185
12,Im not sure if anyone on reddit has ever brought this up before but I just came up with this super unique take on things the other day Twitter is a private company and if people dont like how they run things they are free to leave Private companies can do whatever they want,155
13,they should take a look at reddit first,130
14,If Im being 100 honest I hope he s Twitter,119
15,We have already seen ourselves that the free speech of bombarded misinformation  can cause millions of people to die in a pandemic while they argue about the simplest of PPEMost of humanity couldnt even handle when twitter barely did anything against the misinformationnow it will be in full swingFreedom to spread misinformation is the restriction of truth by overwhelming   proxy,108
16,Expectation No rules no censorship no bans just Wild West freedom Lets goooooReality Similar rules new censorship new bans same corporate control Why,77
17,i thought Twitter was a private company and could do what it wants This is what the left tell me when people complain about censorshipNow they are flipflopping and cryinglmfao,71
18,It wouldnt be so hard if those asshats could give us a straight definition of hate speech Because I know damn well they are gonna classify speech they dont like as hate speech in order to get it  Its a cowards tactic and employed to defend ideas that crumble at the slightest scrutiny He isnt changing it so people can fling racial slurs at each other willy nilly hes changing it because people are getting banned for stating facts that bother protected groups or advocating reasonable opinions that differ from the opinions of the powers that be,51
19,Nobody cared about this shit before Elon bought it everyone was a happy consumer Whatsbouttism and crocodile tears are rampant,46
20,This will go the same way it did when Rupert Murdoch bought MySpace Remind me in 5yrs,45
0,So much for standing up to musk lol Oh you said 46 5 billion i respectfully retract all our previous statements ,7302
1,So Trumps gonna come back to twitter I imagine,3342
2,,3016
3,Why does he want to buy twitter,2948
4,All hype aside I really dont think Twitter is worth that,2300
5,,1944
6,Wont Elon just get rid of the current board,1241
7,I honestly dont think this guy is here to protect free speech Does anyone really think he wont try to shadow ban accounts that push for tesla unionization,777
8,Money talks bullshit walks,645
9,Oh god Elon will have an entire social media platform to manipulate the stock and crypto markets with,618
10,God I hope everyone immediately stops using Twitter,546
11,,484
12,I love how all the Tesla simps are pissing their pants in excitement Theyve evidently not even considered where the 465 billion dollar financing is coming from,425
13,this guy is becoming the world overlord he can influence wars politics economics and will now own one of the worlds foremost way of distributing information look out for musk the guy has more money and power than countries now no one has assented no one has voted him in he could just buy sri lanka at the moment anyone remember antitrust,352
14,Everyone knows Elon is doing this just so he can get the last laugh at the guy tracking his jet on Twitter By banning him,275
15,Elon says we should have an unedited forum of free expression And he wants to control it Twitter has shown itself to be the most effective propaganda tool in history This is a very real step towards a wealth and technology based oligarchic new world order,230
16,Lol while everyone on here was screaming PuMp AnD DuMpLooks like musk is actually going to buy Twitter,228
17,I quit as doomscrolling over Ukraine was impacting my mental healthMusk taking over would convince me never to go back,174
18,,116
19,Ironically if they take the money they prove his point,113
20,I want Musk to buy Twitter and just turn it off,104

6,Most people on the internet want to remain anonymous,2371

10, latimescombusinessstory20220412muskisoffthetwitterboardofdirectorstheteslatwitterbotarmymarchesonIn early November 2013 the news wasnt looking great for Tesla A series of reports had documented instances of Tesla Model S sedans catching on fire causing the electric carmakers share price to tumbleThen on the evening of Nov 7 within a span of 75 minutes eight automated Twitter accounts came to life and began publishing positive sentiments about Tesla Over the next seven years they would post more than 30000 such tweetsWith more than 500 million tweets sent per day across the network that output represents a drop in the ocean But preliminary research from David A Kirsch a professor at the University of Marylands Robert H Smith School of Business concludes that activity of this sort by socalled bots has played a significant part in the stock of the future narrative that has propelled Teslas market value to altitudes loftier than any traditional financial analysis could justify,1122
11,Real human Ted Cruz isnt concerned about this one bit,851
12,1 wait till he bans the guy tracking his plane 2 hes going to give trump his account back 3 have fun with free speech 4 twitter is a dying platform There saved you reading through the other 5000 commentsEdit People seem to think Im expressing my opinion Im simply summarizing the only talking points youll come across in this entire threadEdit 2 Some real gigabrains choosing to repeat one of these four talking points in the replies nearly verbatim and completely unironically lol,787
13,If I had 40 something BILLION dollars to throw away I dont think that Id be dumping it on Twitter,589
14,The guy for free speech is the same one who blocked a bloggers tesla order after he criticized Elon,355
15,Musk has repeatedly referred to Twitter as the de factor public town square of the modern era  the digital equivalent of a public forum  I disagree Twitter looks more like the gossip table of a high school cafeteria,354
16,d,291
17,So lets get this straightElon Musk convicted of using Twitter to commit stock fraud is currently engaged in a lawsuit for allowing outright discrimination along with a hostile work environment in his company who needs a minder to use Twitter so he does not commit fraud is purchasing Twitter,213
18,Countdown until Trump is back on twitter,203
19,It will kill the platform thats probably a good thing,133
20,This is just notveryveiled threat to wipe out online anonymity The thing about Musk is that his stated principles are absolutely castiron his word is his bond  right up until the moment at which he would make more money doing otherwise Make no mistake having an oligarch in sole control of Twitter will mean that its moderation and content policies will reflect only the direct material interests of Musk personally and those of the oligarchic class more generallyIts very simple If Twitter is a public town square then like any public town square it should be publically owned and managed municipally by elected representatives A town square owned by a single capitalist is a strip mall,108
0,The scale of mergers and acquisitions that happened in the past few years are very disturbing,1687
1,Holy shit I cant believe it actually happened,1102
2,RIP the kid that was tracking Elons flights,745
3,Twitter has accepted Elon Musks offer to purchase the company for 44 billion the company announced in a press release today Musk purchased the company at 5420 a share the same price named in his initial offer on April 14th,716
4,Great so in a few months Twitter is the new pol,511
5,I cant imagine having a spare 44B and giving a single shit about social media,358
6,This just in Elon Musk the founder and inventor of Twitter,344
7,Cant wait for all the free speech we are about to endureDo not feed trolls kids,325
8,I hope he s it,263
9,worlds biggest clown buys worlds largest circus,242
10,So that means all shareholder get 5420 per share and then it wont be listed on the stock exchange as it will become private company,139
11,Why would Elon do this I hope he has a great plan and doesnt intend on running it himself,103
12,Im sure stuffed envelopes were exchanged If Musk manipulates Twitter like Zuckerberg does Facebook hell render it irrelevant and biasedEdit Im playing block a mole with all the dipshits that are personally attacking my intelligence for my comment I welcome respectful debate Am I self censoring Of course I am Clarification When I speak of bias I mean the algorithms that reinforce echo chambers to encourage engagement at the price of facts and equity,98
13,I hope this turns out like the MySpace dealRupert Murdochs News Corp bought Myspace and its parent company Intermix in 2009 for 580 million Just a few years later Murdoch sold the obsolete platform to media company Viant for 35 millionLolEdit just wanted to add these statsMonthly Active Users  TikTok officially has over 1 billion monthly active users For reference  active users of other social platforms Facebook  29B YouTube  22B Instagram  14B TikTok  10B Snapchat  500M Pinterest  480M Twitter  397MAnd Musk has said hes gonna get rid of bot accounts,92
14,Musk complains that the UN told him that he could solve world hunger with 6 billion dollars and spends seven times that on twitter,92
15,I for one absolutely expect him to be professional and responsible with his own social media side gig,60
16,Last 10 years I feel like we have accepted our fate that our future is going to be Blade Runner and not Star Trek,54
17,Haha just stop using Twitter and make his entire purchase worthless lol,37
18,Another reason to never create an account,30
19,I was assured by the Top Minds of Reddit that this was a pump and dump scheme,34

7,Over  Under on how many days until Trump is unbannedMy guess is that Trump will be tweeting again within a month,1144
8,,967
9,Cant wait for free speech on Twitter,916
10,What sort of impact do we think this will have on the platform,653
11,I dont really care that he bought I just feel like its pretty silly to think twitter has some secret potential that hasnt been unlocked I guess thats tech bro ego for you,618
12,So whos interested in seeing the algorithms once theyre open source What methods will be used to verify humans and keep out bots Does anyone here actually discuss technology,471
13,Were about to learn he invented Twitter,323
14,If i was elon musk I would close down twitter immediately and then buy Facebook and close it down too,316

1,Heres a thought stop using Twitter as a fucking political platform,6811
2,The fact that Twitter is considered a pillar of our democracy is dangerous itself,4330
3,Billionaires owning almost all media and platforms is bad Not just twitter,2394
4,Twitter is a defacto public forum Politicians use it to make statements comments and to connect with their constituents Trump was sued successfully for blocking people on Twitter because it was his official account and because that is the government blocking people from saying something based on viewpoint When Twitter blocks someone its not the government doing it but rather a private company However politicians should not have been posting on Twitter in an official capacity at all given that it was privately owned and moderated,1301
5,Am I the only one less worried about Musk owning Twitter than at least one of Fox News major commentators taking direct orders from the White House I mean if were going invest in all this outrage lets prioritize,1016
6,Multibillionaires are dangerous to our democracy,523
7,In short money and democracy dont mix We are seeing one tear the other apart,443
8,Some may say that this is extremely dangerous to our democracy httpsyoutubefHfgU8oMSo,301
9,Not that I disagree with her statement but if its that dangerous for democracy then it shouldnt be privately owned,243
10,Will someone please explain to me why this particular billionaire owning this particular social media platform is any different than every other billionaires owning every other social media platform and news outletLike fuck I get that the wealthy having such direct over what voices we hear or what news we see is ripped right from the pages of every dystopia novel but like that ship has kinda sailed already The only thing unique about Musk here is that hes not bright enough to be subtle about it,216
11,I cant believe that social medias are seen as a fucking political platform No wonder everything has gone to shit,217
12,Twitter going the way of MySpace wouldnt be a bad thing ,163
13,Bezos bought wapo and nobody did anything,153
14,Shes a moron Apparently it was fine for our democracy when it was the billionaires she liked owning it before ,91
15,Elected officials using their office to make millions from insider trading is totally fine though No danger there,77
16,Im sure she meant dangerous for democrats,74
17,So how did we go from its a private company and they can ban whoever they want to Elon purchase of Twitter is dangerous for our democracy,67
18,Just when you thought Twitter couldnt possibly be more of a toxic shithole,64
19,Ironic coming Warren and the party of shut up and obey or else peasant And on a platform that has manipulated suppressed and out right censored stories and people for going against their narrative Threat to democracy because Musk bought it Delusional censorship and manipulation by one party is a threat to democracy not some guy buying a company to get it back to its free speech roots,60
20,Career Politicians are MUCH more dangerous for our Democracy than any tweet,60

1,Just to reiterateSEC sued Overstock to save SHFs and stop squeezehttpsthecoinrisecomsecsuesoverstockandexecsforsecuritiesfraud,1664
2,Fuck the SEC,1294
3,Well he speaks the truth The SEC should be defunded and shut down and replaced,676
4,Yup Bent over for the highest bidder like almost every other cunt in the world Ignore me Im hungry,545
5,I dont often agree with Elon but in this case he isnt wrong,303
6,What i think is being overlooked here is that Elon is hinting that the SEC literally did the bidding of short sellers by interfering in the take private agreement Taking Tesla private would mean that all publicly sold shares would get sold at the agreed price of 420 per share at the time 84 per share now after splitThis would have meant that any naked short sales would also need to be fulfilled and the owners of synthetic shares would have to get 420 of cash per synthetic share Then the SEC happenned they actively got in the way by request of SHFs ultimately stopping the deal and crashing the Tesla price again This is the power of SHFsIf you think GME short seller tactics werent used on Tesla I have some magic beans to sell you,144
7,Elon Musk is using his massive wealth to poke wallstreet and the central controlling banks right in the eye That is why he was so brazen about his comments on the Ted Talk That is why his comments were clipped and taken out of context That was a central bank shake down of Tesla  Plead guilty to SEC or we cut off all working capital accounts They had hoped that the fine and bad publicity of an SEC violation would dissuade investors from TESLA Problem is most retail traders now see just how rigged the game is and how feckless the SEC is I am surprised that the DOJ has not been tasked with going after Tesla,95
8,Elon is a tool But he is spot on here,71
9,Elon Musk calls the SEC shameless puppets of Wall St shortseller sharks   and hes right,78
10,Now realize that regulatory capture affects virtually ALL of the government,63
11,Big names calling out bad actors like that LFG,52
12,Tell me youre worthless without telling me youre worthless,37
13,They just borrowed 585 000 according to iborrow desk,28
14,Its a shame Elon cant afford to buy the remainder of the float to trigger MOASS I guess,22
15,Hes a shady prick anyway between Tesla going private pumping his coin slamming that other coin then jumping back on board because of sustainability and now the Twitter shit His views regarding the SEC may align with ours but hes no friend to retail PS sorry for the ambiguity regarding mentioning Coins or almost anything really Superstonk automod is a touchy bitch and removes everything,19
16,fuck gg,19
17,Hes not wrong,16
18,ENOUGH elon musk apartheid emeralds union busting child cobalt mining dirtbag hes the enemy too,14
19,The SEC is a criminal organization,9
20,Shortseller Enrichment Commission,10
0,He will succeed in turning it into a even bigger toxic shit show than it already is,1487
1,Billionaires dont buy things just to kill their investmentMore likely is that he opens things up unbans high profile people etc in the name of free speech The cesspool grows but so do interactions as a resultHis goal is assuring himself a place to control his image through unfiltered communication of his own and money  Best case at this point is that a large portion of the user base leaves over time and it just becomes even more of an echo chamber than it already is for those who remain,768
2,You think Elon will light 50 billion on fire,330
3,rredditmoment,307
4,Highly unlikely Free Speech will just be an encouragement of not so accurate information flowing through the platform with hardly any checks and balances similar to Facebook,118
5,he wont  hell just make it into Parler 20,79
6,That would be an interesting move considering his whole soap box is free speech,46
7,BlueCheckists Twitter is a private company They can have any policies they want If you dont like it start a new platformChaching SOLDBlueCheckists Noooooooooo,36
8,redditors really shitting on twitter like this site is better its not,33
9,That would be a rather expensive stunt,30
10,Acting like reddit isnt a cesspool lmao,31
11,Elon musk directly uses twitter to manipulate the stock market in his favor Hes done it before and now that he cant get banned hell definitely do it again,28
12,Begs the US government not to have to pay taxes Spends 45 billion on free software,18
13,Elon musk is going to use Twitter to stoke the crypto market and the stock market Hes going to turn himself into the richest man in the history of time doing this Hes going to end up the president of the United States of AmericaRemind me 16 years,20
14,Can we please reimpose limits on how many media companies a billionaire can own,19
15,It would be a winwin no twitter and Elon Musk losing a ton of money,15
16,Let the salt flow,14
17,All you have to do if you hate a service is not use it I dont,13
18,He is going to turn it into 4chan or 8chan,13
19,This is an exercise that will probably backfire here for me and get me banned from this sub but it will illustrate my point perfectly If I can now say biological men should not compete with women in sports and not get banned good They shouldnt compete and I should be able to say that without getting doxxed and banned If I can say that men cannot have babies which is true no matter how many ways someone tries to pervert the definition of a man thats fine I should not get banned If I point out the drug and human trafficking problem at the border and mention who the border czar happens to be I shouldnt get banned for misinformation If I want to question why a certain laptop went untouched and undiscussed because talking about it wouldnt put an even bigger dent in Joes nomination I shouldnt get banned There are far too many people on twitter who call everything they dont like hate speech which then allows those people to then paint that topic into obscurity because its something THEY dont want to talk about or THEY dont want to read and they dont want other people to read  Far too liberal lol hypocrites with the label,9
20,God I hope he also buys Reddit,9
0,Now I didnt look into it very deeply so correct me if Im wrong but he said he would give the money if the WHO could show a detailed plan on how it would be used  and they did but all it was was give that country x in food and that country y and it would also not have solved world hunger but ensured no one would go hungry in 2022 which isnt the same by a longshot,6660
1,Better yet just  your Twitter and never come back lol,2116
2,the world has plenty of food 6 billion wont defeat world hunger ending corrupt governments and misuse of peoples money will also distributing food properly and not letting it go to waste by feeding those who cant afford much will help tremendously,803
3,Regardless of my view on this I do not feel this kind of post fits this sub,721
4,How is this Antiwork,242
5,I dont want to side with Elon But the proposal put together by the UN doesnt solve world hunger It simply delays it,218
6,Homeboy really woke up and thought hed take down twitter today ,197
7,Better yet eat the rich,164
8,Twitter shareholders now have 44B in cash great news they can end world hunger now,163
9,Id go farther just dont use Twitter ever,106
10,Unionize Tesla nytimescom20210325businessmusklaborboardhtmlUnion busting emerald slaver,63
11,He promised 6 billion if they gave him a well formulated plan on how to end world hunger as they initially claimed widely as a PR stunt They replied and said well actually 6 billion wouldnt solve anything But it would be enough to give meals worldwide for a year and then world hunger would continue just the same afterwardsIf anyone here actually thinks that is good Maybe I should spend less time here I thought my peers of anti work were a lot smarter than thatEdit 1After looking further a few of you have pointed this out and its great to see,67
12,I d Twitter years ago Im surprised you still use that crap platform As for Elons tweet he said he would donate the money if he would be shown exactly how the money would be spent and how it would solve world hunger That part of the agreement was never honoured Elon isnt particularly doing anything wrong in this case,35
13,you singlehandedly took down twitter amazing,36
14,we all recognize  As soon as I see a sentence that starts that way I am immediately opposed to whatever it says next,33
15,Thats not what he said,26
16,I mean not for nothing but httpsfortunecom20220215elonmusk57billiondonationweeksafteraskingunworldhungertextElon20Musk20donated20around2024574right20now20and20do20itE2809D,27
17,What does this have to do with anti work,27
18,You didnt look up any of these things youre angry about huh  What he said was a challenge to the WHO if you can give me a plan that will work for 6B then Ill pay for it  The WHO couldnt come up with a plan that would work  They basically just sent him a list that was like Give country X give country Y none of it would solve world hunger  Im by no means a Musk apologist but he didnt promise 6B he gave a big fat fuck you to all the people who claim he could solve world hunger if he wanted to  If the people who are supposedly the experts on this cant even come up with a legitimate plan why in the world should he fill up the pockets of all the grifters all over the world keeping those countries hungry in the first place,26
19,This is not antiwork Take this post somewhere else,28

1,Number 1 londonLondon  has trains in tunnelsWe already fine Elon its just people are dumb,2789
2,1 Car traffic is the wrong metric2 This is the most expensive possible way to add just one more lane,1878
3,To much traffic Well then why dont we add more streets Just underground,958
4,From when was this data Paris is working hard on this problemUnbelievable that this guy is still going on about tunnels and the Vegas ride didnt humble him,803
5,Live in BrusselsUsing a bike Going everywhere in the city within 20 minutesNever been stuck in traffic,340
6,imagine being so ridiculously filthy rich that it just does not matter how stupid you are,268
7,Am I the only one who suspects that the entire reason the Boring Company exists is to fool investors into paying for RD for Elons dreams of building colonies on Mars  Tunneling equipment is heavy as hell but it might be a lot less heavy than bringing building materials to Mars And one of the best ways to protect humans from the surface radiation on Mars which is 50 times higher than on Earth would be to have them sleep in underground habitats,149

11,There is a limit to how much tunnel you can add because at some point if you have to do 20km down and up or left and right to get to a tunnel with no traffic and its not worth it anymore so there will be a hard limit on how many tunnel you can make to keep it interesting and that hard limit increases only if traffic gets worseThe problem is traffic not the number of lanes,67
12,Yes lets build tunnels in Paris Kinda like THE FUCKING METRO omfg,55
13,By the way philly is like 15 which is why you should join rCarfreePhilly,45
14,Traffic  CongestionBut Elon surely knows that hes a genius Obviously,27
15,The Hyperloop is a scam and generally incredibly stupid,25
16,Elon So hear me out Its like a subway but its also a traffic jam,29
17,An immature tad unstable tempered blood diamond inheritance brat That does vanity projects under the guise of green washing And expanding man to the stars His fragile child like ego is bigger than his wealth,25
18,Traffic in Brussels I just use the train or metroIf only if we could figure out how those wise people made them possible ,19
19,Virgin Elon musk WhY dOnT wE aDd TuNnElS uNdEr LoNdOn shat on price transport in Vegas steals other peoples ideas saves the car industry and not the planetChad metropolitan and City and South London railways actually innovates in public transport creates a mass transit system that has lasted 150 years eventually uses clean energy,19
20,Hey Elon have you ever tried to dig one meter under the city of Rome,18
0,You linked a tweet from yourselfHow about you just dont use Twitter as a start,1154
1,Why is this in reconomy,624
2,Allowing tweets on reconomy is mindblowing to me lol,405
3,Can we please get this guy and UnionPacific1 the fuck off this sub  All they do is shitpost,202
4,I havent used twitter and I wont use twitter now But I find it fascinating that there has been little to no discussion about Bezos and The Washington Post while Twitter being owned by someone who is seemingly not completely aligned with the left is seen as some type of mortal threat,161
5,Why are angsty tweets being posted on a economics sub,101
6,Cringe headline this sub is so off topic most of the time,73
7,Wait Elon is an oligarch please keep the upvotes at 69,68
8,Jeeez its Twitter Just  your account or never create one Get it together,65
9,Joined this sub to talk about economy Instead Im here seeing shit about politics that I dont care about,49
10,This headline is perhaps the most obnoxious thing that I have read this morning although it is not even 930 I find it distressing that it would be posted under a site called economy as I would expect they would have better QC This reads like a preachy 7th grader wrote it,49
11,WTF are you talking about  Twitter silenced conservatives constantly,26
12,Its fucked because Elon is right Free speech has become a BAD thing for the left,26
13,Why does this ufailedevolution guy keep posting nonsense over and over again about Elon,23
14,This is the system working as intended Someone doesnt know how a free market economy works It isnt broken its functional,20
15,Grow the fuck up,23
16,Try being objective Is the current board that good Twitter has been ill with a number of serious problems for many years now Its not clear say how exactly Elon would approach the problem of bots or paid shills but he would do something and its possible things would even improve,17
17,Jealous much This headline just screams of envy,18
18,I might use Twitter again if it actually does become a free speech platform I doubt it will though Ad revenue doesnt seem to like cesspools that emerge when free speech is allowed Theres a reason all those image boards had trouble staying alive years ago,14
19,oh boo hoo daddy elon bought your safe space and your liberal echonchamber might crack atleast you still have reddit,11
20,Angry wokeness  the totally Fcked up democratic party So go do your thing,10
0,Lets get teslaunion going and see how fast he shows how much he actually believes in others free speech,4428
1,He wants free speech Doesnt mean he is going to share it,1448
2,My favorite take on Musks Twitter purchaseBREAKING Man Makes Midlife Crisis Everybodys Problem,943
3,History shows that Emperors Aristocrats and Oligarchs tend to prefer controlling speech,904
4,Free speech Lets see how quickly he shuts down Elon tracker any bets,684
5,Haha Ill believe him when he lets his employees talk about unions,436
6,Elon musk is a social media whore obsessed with Twitter,279
7,Elon did NOT sink billions into free speechHe needs a new gimmick  Tesla is over 200 to 1 PE ratio and Ford is hot on his heels theres a limited market for sub orbital tourism and his satellite internet still underwhelmsNeedless to say we arent living in Mars  he isnt planting chips in anyone and there will be no human like servant robotsOr any of the other concepts he ripped off from films he watched over a late night burrito and a DoobieIm thinking that rising interest rates are worrying him  Debt is still debt and you need to service it  A subscription service for twitter helpsAnd it doesnt hurt to have your own private media outlet,230
8,Elon Musk is just another rich narcissist who wants to rule the world one way or another  We really need to pay closer attention to rich people they usually arent as wonderful as we think,199
9,Man real fucking sick of reading about Elon Musk,97
10,unless youre a whistleblower or an employee trying to unionize,83
11,Freedom of the Press belongs to those who own pressesAnd hes trying to buy the biggest press in the world,72
12,Free from responsibility and consequences is not free speech in most peoples minds,67
13,Come on guys  this billionaire really cares about all of us and our freedoms,63
14,Elon Musk wants speech without consequences especially for the rich not free speech there is a stark difference,61
15,Anyone whos ever gotten into a Twitter argument should never own Twitter,52
16,When some former employee starts tweeting about the shit going on at Tesla well see how much free speech he allows,39
17,And Reddit has a meltdown I love it,37
18,Free speech from a billionaire is what he means,35
19,He bought Twitter for the same reason any rich person buys a media outlet Its not for freedom of speech Its to control the rhetoric,29
20,Hes a fan of the Do as I say not as I do school of Free Speech,24
0,Im not sure if everyones aware but you dont have to actually use Twitter at all,5135
1,The announcement says it sold for 44billion at 5420 per share and will become a privately held company after the sale is finalized,3562
2,Holy shit Even after everything recently I did not expect this,2283
3,Bro got bullied on Twitter so hard he had to buy the whole company,2151
4,Acquisition pricesTwitter 44 billion Elon MuskSlack 28 billion SalesforceLinkedIn 26 billion MicrosoftWhatsApp 19 billion FacebookSkype 85 billion MicrosoftYouTube 165 billion GoogleTumblr 11 billion YahooInstagram 1 billion Facebook,2142
5,This is basically the ultimate version of FU money,1595
6,How long until Trump is unbanned,1568
7,The scale of mergers and acquisitions that happened in the past few years are very disturbing,1462
8,This is sure to make Mr Musk more down to earth and humble,1331
9,A narcissistic billionaire with a temper of vindictive teenager just bought one of the biggest communication channels for the whole world under the guise of freedom from consequences and regulations for himWhat could go wrong eh,968
10,I cant wait for his legion of followers to tell me in a couple of years how he invented social media with Twitter,817
11,Anyone who genuinely thinks hes doing this out of anything other than self interest shouldnt be allowed to operate scissors unsupervised,793
12,Just in Twitter becomes the new 4chan,688
13,Fun idea for experimentAfter take over is done and dusted create twitter account that posts nothing but pictures of the gaps in tesla body panels and see how quick it gets banned,598
14,Good Lord this is some dystopian nightmare where billionaires are just casually playing around with assets like Twitter,543
15,44 billion dollars I got it free slaps knee,484
16,Quick everyone start trending unionizetesla,385
17,Well it was a nice few years without hearing from Trump and watching his various social media apps fail miserably,273
18,This is going to go down as one of the biggest overpays in history,253
19,It annoys me to no end when people say we cant tax billionaires because supposedly their wealth does not exist in a liquid form and is completely tied up in their stocks yet here goes musk on a quick personal 44 billion acquisition like it is nothing,253
20,Does this mean we can stop taking Twitter seriously Cause I would love that Trending twitter trends shouldnt be on the News,251
0,The amount of people here to stan for a Billionaire is too damn highIf you are an Elon fan or any billionaire for that matter you are not an ally of the antiwork movement These chuckle fuck rich boys are using money extracted from 100s of millions of working class people around the world to buy and sell large parts of our modern communication and news systems among so many other things and still people show up in here to clap enthusiastically for the funny meme man who said the thing from the internet He must be a good guy,829
1,Christ itd be amazing if twitter formed a union before the deal went through,716
2,Im still amazed Elon actually has a fanboy group despite literally getting rich off of blood emeraldsThen again I sincerely believe there are people out there who wish they could have gotten rich off blood emeralds,192
3,Ooh if Elon bought Twitter to protect freedom of speech we should make things that dont paint him in a good light as viral as we can,61
4,Elon will make Trump become President again lol,41
5,Complete over reaction Its far more likely Musk will just call anyone he doesnt like a pedo,25
6,He also clearly bought Twitter because he was soft cancelled still popular but not mainstream popular After Musk called a diver a pedophile for criticizing how he tries to grab headlines with his half assed inventions This is the rich using their power to avoid bad headlines and censorsue poor people He can also use section 230 since he wasnt able to successfully lobby for it to be limited,25
7,Can we all put some money together and buy Elon Musk,20
8,Rip Twitter,21
9,Im not an Elon fan but I hate Twitter more than Elon so I am team Elon on this issue Fuck twitter,17
10,As someone who worked at Tesla anyone who works at any company ran by him has an extremely high chance of being severely disappointed and worked to deathThe work is built to such a point that any and all human functions are regulated to assembly line procedures in order to meet the high publicized demand as he is a numbers man and is focused on results first with little regard for casualties sustained and a burnt out workforceNot to mention the mental health factor and the pay The pay can be godawful And being driven to the point of daily mental breakdowns panic attacks and tumultuous depressionJust my opinion But chances are it wont fare many changes for the better as opposed to what it is now and what will be expected as usualWhen I was in anyone who caught trying to unionize was promptly fired They spared no time in dismantling any signs of an attempt to unionize Cant imagine whats about to fare here,13
11,So in your fantasy world the billionaires that currently own Twitter are fine Lol,12
12,Just reminder he and his brother got 28k to start their internet business and never got another dime  lets not act like he got half a million dollars to start his first business,9
13,She is going to be able to continue to say that Hes already asked his critics to stay on Twitter I dont use Twitter so dont really give a shit but I dont see Elon buying Twitter to be an authoritarian dictator of free speech Just my 02,9
14,Guys elon isnt going to ban all anti elon speech from Twitter that is not how the company works lmao Elon isnt going to be stalking twitter waiting to unleash the hounds of hell on anyone who dares oppose him Buying twitter is just an overblown publicity stunt,8
15,could anyone point me to the source for the emerald mine inheritance claim I understand his lifestyle precollege was funded by his fathers ownership of it but I cant find anything on the inheritance after he left SA,8
16,Elon Musk  Hank Scorpio,5
17,Elon simp are the worst,6

11,Elons gonna buy the world ,7
12,Tbh I think people should be able to say whatever they want slurs and all Obviously there are consequences for saying things and those consequences would be a direct result of the free speech but everyone should be free to get their teeth knocked in say what they want,9
13,Why would he need a pass dudes African,9

1,Of course he will,3631
2,I just want to say how nice its been to have had a break from all the Trumpery that overtook Twitter awhile back Ah good times,1428
3,Republicans should be worried too If DJT comes back they will be back to spending every waking moment trying to defend what ever batshit crazy thing he tweets out from the toilet,911
4,Im so glad I never got into Twitter Reddit is bad enough,660
5,Hes clearly not buying Twitter because he wants to make money He has smarter things to invest in for that Which is why its so scary He has nefarious reasons for it Expect right wing nonsense to completely dominate Twitter in under a year Especially anti labor union rhetoric,490
6,Under Musk Twitter will be a rallying point for hate speech and domestic terrorism under the guise of the free speech Musk professes Of course that free speech will not be afforded to Musks detractors,399
7,So much for Twitter banning hate speech Just in time for another election shit show,350
8,You know someone said the other day in a different thread about this topic but the fact that Elon Musk cant run for president is probably one of the few saving graces we have left,287
9,Trump just said Dont expect him back on Twitter so you better bet on it,276
10,Musk isnt after free speech  He wants to have a platform where he has no one to tell him no  I deactivated my account 20 minutes ago and am thankful he bought it  Twitter was a bad habit,169
11,Musk is going to kill Twitter which may be for the best  He is too thin skinned and will start banning people for trending things that reflect poorly on him And once the more liberal folks start that up it will be a trainwreck,155
12,Free Speech Absolutist Elon Musk has blocked countless people for simply criticizing some of his companies,143
13,I just deactivated  Hopefully everyone else does too so its just corporations and right wing bots Not like you cant see embedded tweets on news sites anyway,126
14,Wow yikes insane One man controls so much Its insane Musk will in exchange be friendly to conservatives and hell get billions in govt contracts Tax rebates 0 property taxes in new locationsI believe hell give conservative preference and get political favors in exchange Conservative also played the victim card Oh the board has to look at this deal They arent Its corrupt I fear democrats need to realize trumpism and its type are hear and the rich are flexing their bank accounts and they are in serious trouble,78
15,maybe we should tax the rich more so they cant just off and buy every single major company they want,55
16,Musk just bought himself the Trump problem  Who the fuck would want to buy that  Its now him as an individual who has to make his product available to Trump hate speech and disinformation  Previously Twitter could hide behind policy  Now Musk is going to be asked continuously to hand over his investment to Truth Social and ParlerI think Twitter might have to be either pro or antiTrump at this point and be all the way in  I doubt Elon thought this out but this is what he bought  Trump can only devalue anything he touches,51
17,I just love articles that claim officials are doing something  but then fail to name one single official,34
18,Would there be a financial incentive to bring Trump back to the siteI mean Twitter took on untold levels of risk when he was president because of the legal uncertainty of him using Twitter as the presidencies official platform but even as an expresident there are liability concerns when you think of Trump  Also Twitter is a free to use site which means it survives on advertiser dollars but Trump is not advertiser friendlyI mean Elon Musk is also a right wing rich person but I cant see the financial incentive he would stand to gain by letting Trump back on the platform,30
19,They should be worrying about inflation,26
20,Every true American should be concerned that the man who attempted a coup against our country might be given his biggest microphone backDont worry Devin Nunez says otherwisehttpstwittercomRonFilipkowskistatus1518584575781482496video1,27

1,Can you imagine if the kid took the 5k d the account and then created a new one doing the same thing,1503
2,Paying 50k is a lot more likely to create copy cats than 5k,1258
3,d,883
4,I think he flew a little too close to the sun Elon knows most likely someone else could restart the same account And if the payout is 50k thats only going to create an entire army of people tracking him hoping for a buyout Im guessing this kid posted this convo himself too which even if elon was going to do it he sure as fuck wont after you advertised it lol,689
5,I am going to spend 44b to ban you you little shit,480
6,If Elon s the kids account he should just move over to instagram which has actual users,300
7,This kid out trolled Elon into buying Twitter,252
8,Fifty thousand  You want fifty thousand dollars  Well heres forty five fucking billion dollars you fuck,123
9,I really hope that Elon tweets out should have took the 5k,111
10,rwallstreetmuskposting,61
11,Its not like the kid will disappear He can still do what he was doing on loads of platforms,60
12,There it is Now instead of suppressing one account he can suppress all current and future accounts,52
13,Guy has space land underground and cyberspace  If he gets water he become Captain Planet,33
14,A smart dude would take the 5k give up his account and help Elon Notice the generally helping make it slightly harder Bruh that could be a invite Maybe could eventually get a job or better private offer as thanks   But now thanks to his greed and shortsightness he got nothing clearly one of us xD,29
15,Imma be real G you are worth like 7 gorillion You probably pay more to the middle schooler with safety scissors that cuts your hair Ill take a no show job at whatever meme factory you are building and an old pair of Amber Heards shoes to sell online,28
16,The kid probably owned Twitter calls and played chess not checkers Win Elon pays him 50kWin Elon buys Twitter and he makes 50k on Twitter calls,20
17,Can someone please explain this to me,19
18,lol despite massive TSLA wins and losses recieved by this sub Elon is possibly the douchiest tool to walk the planet,17
19,The kid could of gotten 50k if he was willing to keep it secret Posting about asking for 50k means that elon cant give him it without attracting more stalkers,15
20,I went to buy a car advertised at xxxx and when I got there the guy said how about xxxxx because the market is going up  I take that personally  He texted me three times as we were backing down his driveway,13
0,Take the money and run But man the memes are about to get SPICY,410
1,lol this is hilariousI dont use twitter anyway its a terrible toxic mess  Will be interesting to see what happens to it under Musks ownership,272
2,,210
3,Twitter cheaper than Activison  What ,162
4,We are entering a second gilded age Instead of building railroads the robber barons are from the tech industry,156
5,I think Musk is going to quickly realise why Twitter censor so much speech and he will do the same thing and people will turn on him Business as usual,140
6,Remember when twitter was exciting because it gave people in countries that were being oppressed and overtaken a voice,145
7,,100
8,Will be interesting to see if twitter will survive this Musk on his own is enough to annoy people Unmoderated social media quickly descends into a really awful mess and twitter still has to adhere to the laws of various countries like Germany and the EU has introduced a law as well nprorg202204231094485542eulawbigtechhatespeechdisinformation nprorg202204231094485542eulawbigtechhatespeechdisinformationWhich means that twitter will actually have to have even more strict moderation if they want to operate in Europe The EU wont fuck around and a lot of people dont like Musk and I could see some gunning for him if he flouts that law,74
9,The worst part about the US is that whether its good or bad money always wins  Which is why much of the country isnt getting their needs met and hasnt been for at least 20 to 30 years It really sucks how a small group of 712 people can throw around so much weight while average people cant even get a fair wage,46
10,Facebook losing daily users Netflix losing subscribers and now Twitter is going to be broken because this fakehaired baby is a Free Speech Absolutist,34
11,Somehow I think hes buying this for the data Open AI Another Musk project can just ingest everything from Twitter into their GTP platforms and create the largest neural network imaginable,34
12,This comment section is a shitstorm between antibillionaires and billionaire nutriders lol,33
13,Twitter is a cesspool as it is Its become a fucking weird place where someone can doxx and harass people you dont agree with but as soon as you call someone a fucking moron you get banned,24
14,Ill wait and see what Musk plans on doing before jumping off the shipThere are potential improvements  AI detectionremoval of bots and troll farm networks would make the interaction more authentic and genuine private groups would be nice etc,16
15,All I can say is buckle up Elon this will be entirely different than your automobile company and your space companyWith those ventures youre dealing with advancing technology with social media youre dealing with managing human interaction,12
16,45 billion that could change the world Instead this asshle buys a social media platform,11
17,Whatever  Musks spoiled rich boys midlife crisis continues,10
18,,8
19,Why exactly do people seem to care so much Its not like his ownership would make it much worse Is it just standard Musk hatred,5

7,Extremely gory is a stretch unless you can get a pastrami slicer as a weapon and put someones face in it and I missed it,411
8,elon musk is the embodiment of a puckered but holetry fingeredit for the record puckered but holes are pretty cool elon musk is not i meant no offense to puckered but holes by comparing them to elon musk,392
9,,292
10,Man theres no escaping Elon tweets on this website lmao,147
11,because theyre hacked  the man is an idiot,145
12,It is not the panties that are banned its the hacked panties that areMusk and his persecutioncomplexfueled Libertarianism are really getting annoying,137
13,As confused halfinformed and out of touch as ever Elon,131
14,Its deeply troubling that the worlds wealthiest man thought by many to be very intelligent and the man that wants to buy Twitter to stop the spread of disinformation doesnt even read articles Were fucked,95
15,Today Elon will continue pretending he alone can save free speech with rolls dice to check dumb takes on video game articles,96
16,Elon is maidenless,91
17,Hes turning into a classic boomer at this point,74
18,Wow what a surprise Elon tweeting about stuff he doesnt understand,73
19,Fck off musk,53

2,unionizeTeslaOk,1895
3,Would be funny if we got the hash tag unionizeTesla trending on Twitter,1461
4,Is his entire reason for existing just to be a rich asshole,1001
5,So Elon borrowed against his Tesla shares in order to buy Twitter If the price of Tesla drops too much which could happen if employees unionize then the loans will hit their margin call and a portion of Elons Telsa stock will be liquidated This would further kill Teslas share price diminish Elons Tesla ownership and also force Elon to pay taxes on the liquidated sharesTLDR  Elons a reckless dumbass,332
6,God I hate this guy and his rabid fan base Hes a frat boi with hair plugs still trying to prove how his dik is the biggest hed be a sad sack of a man if his family didnt have money,294
7,Ok so we have the fuck around part of the equation now lets get the ball rolling on the other part,216
8,This is older news March 3rd and as of March 29th the UAW already stated they hadnt had any contact with Tesla about unionizing OP is phishing for free karma riding on the tail of todays news about the Twitter sale Forget Musk and his ploys to keep receiving free advertising Can we quit watching Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and focus on changing employeremployee relations at levels we can make progress in realistically Whats the union situation at your own job in you local town in general Are your current existing unions doing their job or are they getting corrupted internally like our corporations have Hard enough to get something started harder still to maintain it after,149
9,Musk singlehandedly drove me away ha from buying Tesla anything Hes a rampaging anal fissure,124
10,Im so tired of this dick,113
11,Tesla is a public company  Hes behest to shareholders to maximize THEIR value and they WILL sue his fucking greedy ass if he loses them money Px200BFuck Im so sick of this jerkoff   and especially the cult of Elon jerks that suck his dick after every tweet  Its almost as bad as Trumpy Bois ,55
12,Okay this should be good,35
13,Bahaha get it going Theyre already 7 months behind on average lets see what he does if they unionize,31
14,Pro free speech but not in his workplace huh,28
15,fucking bet,21
16,Good Do it,17
17,Tesla pays their warehouse workers 13 an hour Thats not compensating well,15
18,Hes just such a chode,13
19,Oh look racist idiot says stupid things  bloombergcomnewsarticles20220414teslaracismcaseawardcutto15millionfrom137million,12
20,This man is not a hero,11
0,Musk is like the cliche libertarian He talks a big game but his actions show he is the opposite of what he claims As with all things libertarian its all smoke and mirrors to project,844
1,Has Musk actually ever done anything to advance the cause of free speech Besides posting about it on Twitter,597
2,SeriouslyDo you really want someone who asked an authoritarian government to censor opinions about his product to be in charge of free speech,320
3,Dude has a god complex if he thinks he is the arbiter of free speech  Do not get suckered into believing the mythologies people create around themselves  Stop idolizing the rich,252
4, Im old enough to remember when Elon Musk ordered his private investigators to make a Tesla employees life a living hellincluding having the employee SWATTEDfor tipping off a reporter to waste at a Tesla factory The employee had to move his family to Hungary for safetyI tried to factcheck this oneThis is related to the saga of Martin Tripp He and Tesla sued each other and this is part of Tripps allegations Tripps claims were all dismissed by the judge and Tesla ended up winning  400K from him on their claims So not exactly the most reliable story,75
5,Like when he repeatedly failed in suing Top Gear bc they trashed his trash roadsters,76
6,Pretty much all of the ideals that Musk has mentioned or rather all of those that his cult followers have attributed to him will only last as long at twitter once they figure out which ones hurt the companys bottom line  100 human authentication and absolute free speech may sound great in principleuntil it starts eating in to profits  The reality of the free market is that the free market is going to do whatever makes it the most money  highminded ideals dont last so long in that environment,47
7,The first comment was  Fairly obvious ideas for a comic book villain narcissistTwitter takeover for free speechElon Musk keeps tweeting that he loves free speech So heres a thread with just a few of

raise Teslas stock priceAs a PR stunt Musk promised to build a minisubmarine to rescue a boys soccer team that got trapped in a Thai cave in 2018 After receiving vitriol from the Thai and rescue community Musk called one of the cave rescuers a pedophileAfter saying that the coronavirus pandemic wasnt even in the top 100 health concerns Musk said that ventilators were not needed and there would not be a shortage When it became obvious to all of the public that wed need more ventilators at hospitals car manufacturers were being asked to shift production and make more ventilators Under public pressure and as we starter running out of ventilators so already too late to help the first wave he promised to start making some Then instead of making ventilators he went on the open market and outbid someone to buy some machines By March 24 he told the public and the gov of California he had already delivered 1200 ventilators to the state prompting the governor to thank him publicly  newsweekcomelonmuskteslaventilatorscoronaviruscovid19californiagovernorgavinnewsom1493914 Several weeks later neither the California gov nor the media could find any of these donations By mid April as the media tried to track these donations they only found hospitals that said that the machines they received from Musk were not ventilators useful for the fight against covid19 but instead they received much cheaper and less useful biPAP or CPAC machines that typically cost 20 times less than a ventilator  newsweekcomelonmuskteslaventilatorscoronaviruscovid19californiahospitalslistgavinnewsom1498491 As far as I can tell Tesla never made a single ventilator And Musk never delivered a single actual

httpstwittercomCaptAmazostatus1518588084459384832,48
8,Is this actually in doubt  When those kids were trapped in that cave he falsely labeled the person who criticized his idea of a mini sub rescue a pedophile in retaliation  Of course he doesnt believe in free speech,40
9,Im not especially concerned about this From what Ive read Musk clearly hasnt thought very deeply about it His ideas are really simplistic and generally he doesnt get the stuff Jack had to get to make him pay attention When big celebrities start putting him on blast bc Alex Jones is sending mobs of antisemites and wackos threatening to murderrape them hell realize why Twitter is the way it is nowIdeas like positive free speech and negative free speech dont even seem to be in his vocabulary He does dumb stuff like conflate the loony left with the loony right when the loony lefts big move is major property redistribution and the loony rights is genocide His level of discussion is about the same as most 19 year olds entering an intro to philosophy class And even though people dont like it theres a pretty big group effect once people start jumping platforms If Musk makes it as crappy as it used to be someone will make an alternative or adapt one Something will come along and big names will start hopping to whatever new microblogging platform develops and then their followers will go Weve seen it happen quickly with snapchat to instagram Tik Tok is a little different but its a 2nd gen Vine and people are leaving insta who are more video focused People are leaving facebook in droves and its becoming a boomer ghetto I assume this will be about the sameWhat I do think would be cool is if some of the twitter people who dont like Musk start up one with clearer and consistent guidelines and set it up as a nonprofit with a board of people who do think about free speech about political censorship about how facebook was used for genocide in Myanmar about how China uses it for social control how bot networks work etc,36
10,In a perfect world the SEC and the FCC wouldnt allow this acquisition because he manipulated the stock prices and would use twitter to signal boost his manipulations going forward with no oversightUnfortunately we live in a world where a man who thought you could inject bleach and use really bright lights to cure covid got 47 of the popular vote,25
11,If Superman were real Elon Musk would be the guy trying to kill him,13
12,And then the fanboys say Nuhuh youre just jealous,9
13,But guys rjoerogan and rpoliticalcompassmemes assured me that Elon is BASED and only has the best interests of mankind in mind,11
14,Am I dumb I read the very first link from Bloomberg and it doesnt say tesla asked  china to censor anythingLittle confused here,9
15,Sometimes I miss RES Theres a few people in there that I want to tag as Musks nob gobbler,8
16,Musk also has a legion of sycophants in the media blogosphere and social media that he has exploited in the past to attempt to destroy Tesla critics and shortsellers,5
17,I believe hes just buying Twitter to get rednecks to buy Teslas,5
18,A billionaire abusing their power Impossible Its never happened unlike massive voter fraud Youre just jealous s,2
19,Seems like a good argument against censorship Because we dont want those in power to have the power to control the exchange of thoughts and ideas Its easy to support it when the subject of censorship is vile like hateful speech but its imperative that we test this idea by asking how we would feel about censorship if someone we vehemently disagree with and distrust had the censorship powers,2
20,That comment was very hard to follow Was the formatting really confusing for anyone elseI do hate Elon and have hated him since his rants against public transportation so I guess I dont really need to read it,2
0,I bet the first thing he does is silence the guy who tweets Elons location,923
1,hopefully hell allow tesla workers to organize unions on twitter too,366
2,So Im guessing this is why doge is doing good,222
3,Doesnt he have a history of silencing and retaliating against his critics Lol,219
4,Lets pool our money and buy YouTube back,129
5,Sorry for the Dum question  Elon buys Twitter so Dodgecoin is rising because he will allow tipping ppl with Dogecoin,65
6,Does nobody know freedom of speech only protects against the government censoring you,52
7,Free speech means no repercussions from the government for what you say andor write I hope Twitter remains a place that tries to limit falsehoods,50
8,Is Elon going to allow his critics to say whatever they want about him and his businesses even if it gets to a point where cancel culture starts to impact them in a negative way potentially costing him millions,43
9,NarratorIt was then that Elons critics were  from Twitter,39
10,Hopefully hell get rid of the spam bots,24
11,This has nothing to do with Dogecoin,23
12,d,21
13,The real question does Elon know what free speech is,18
14,Elon is trash,19
15,Free speech means the government cant punish you for most speech and has nothing to do with Twitter or FB,19
16,Im just surprised Twitter still has so much pull Maybe anecdotal to my life but I feel like Twitter was nothing but a bridge between MySpace dying out and Facebook exploding back in like 2008 ish then basically everyone I knew stopped using it and just went to Facebook and Instagram Anyways to the moon ,15
17,Elon should pay for Twitter with doge,10
18,Paving the way for a Trump return to Twitter I see,10
19,This will be in ragedlikemilk in a week,10
20,Not Trump Not again,7
0,heres some articles that explain what the tweet is talking about and what the world food programs plan was for ending world hunger and how musk backed out of donating the money he said he was going to on Twitter1  commondreamsorgnews20211116unfoodchiefdetailshowmegarichelonmuskcouldspendjust66billionavert2 cnncom20211118techelonmuskworldhungerwfpdonationindexhtml,1
1,Hes got his FoS and those that agree with him  When the speech is something he doesnt like hes very procensorship cnbccom20220425elonmuskandfreespeechtrackrecordnotencouraginghtmlId say F for twatter but I never had any respect for them to give,315
2,At first I thought Musk was  tech genius who truly cared about saving the planet but nope he really a selfish entitled asshold just like every other excessively rich person,235
3,All Billionaires Are Bastards,232
4,This is exactly why having billionaires is an existential crisis to our democracy and country as a whole,211
5,Hes a fucking jokeFact of the matter and proof rich people do not give a fuck about us at all none literally 0,75
6,With 44 billion dollars musk could have used that amount of money to end world hunger but instead hes using it to turn twitter into his own fun house,77
7,Geez I thought I hated his actions before but this is the topper,37
8,Twitter has been a large part in Organizing the recent Union victories Elon wants to be able to shut that down if it comes to his companies,30
9,Buying it TO CONTROL free speech,29
10,The 6 billion wasnt enough to end world hunger but it would still have done a lot of good,19
11,We should create a game show called Who Wants To Be A MillionaireExcept all the participants are billionaires and theyre entered via a lotteryThe qualifications are be a billionaire and no one is exemptAll the money goes to charities to fight world hungerpollutiondeforestationetc,19
12,Oh god the Musk stans are swarming,19
13,Its all about power and control Always will be That said those funds could have been better spent Misguided priorities questionable moral compass Perhaps the ultrarich are a study of all that can go wrong with a human being,11
14,Solving world hunger does not directly benefit billionaires in any manner that is meaningful to themThey are psychopaths,11
15,Friendly reminder that speech isnt free if it oppresses others Freedom for all or freedom for none,11
16,This was about extending an olive branch to the Republican politicians so they stay out of his corporations way in the coming yearsHe will let them say anything so long as they dont tax him like they would anyone else hoarding wealthOh ya just a reminder that Ive been saying this for years They are coming after our platforms and reddit is next,11
17,He is not here to solve any one hunger other than his hunger for power,7
18,So when are we gonna start the revolution,7
19,I deactivated my account last night in 30 days it will be permanently d I strongly advise everyone else to do the same,5
20,There is something wrong with Musk Definitely Serial Killer Vibes,4
0,Its fun to think about CEOs just casually texting each other,2810
1,The question is when exactly Because if he rode it down from 1200 to 880 he banked big time,981
2,Bear gates,721
3,I dont know if you can say that Tesla is the company doing the most to solve climate change  At the end of the day theyre still producing and selling automobiles designed for individualsmall group use   Even if their car lifecycle from minerals in the Earth to the last day of car ownership has less of an impact that gaspowered cars thats a pretty low bar to step over   Its not like Tesla is aiming to replace cars with say bikes mass transportation or even videoconferencing Its fair to say that Zoom Trek and Piaggio have done far more for climate change than Tesla has Maybe even Microsoft,616
4,Bill gates seems like the type of guy who had sex with his wife fully dressed and just stuck his penis out the front of his pants,269
5,So no dates on the texts probably indicates this didnt happen recently They were intentionally taken immediately after Also I would be very skeptical about a random text thread that supposedly between two elites as if it was true this would probably not hit the media without someone getting smacked with a civil suit,259
6,I find it disingenous to argue that shorting Tesla means you want them to go bankruptYou can think Tesla is a great company with a good mission and still think their stock is obscenely overvalued,214
7,This Is just about the least convincing thing Ive ever seen,146
8,Elon musk is a douchebag,110
9,Gates doesnt manage his own investments I doubt he knows the details of all the positions cascade owns This feels fake,81
10,Wow this post really brought in the Q cult,78
11,WHO CARES,67
12,Thread is full of Qanon loons,57
13,Hes deluded if he thinks Tesla is doing more than anyone for climate change I guess we already knew that though,55
14,Half a billion How can someone put 0much on ONE play,33
15,Wow So Elon refused to help in the climate change philanthropic endeavor because Gates portfolio managers took a short position in his company What a petty  selfish guy Elon is Also folks please be aware that Gates has such a vast portfolio which he does not manage himself like we peasants have to manage our own measly portfolios He has a team of portfolio managers who make these decisions,27
16,Weak excuse by Musk   If Musk gave a singular fuck about climate change he would have made an affordable EV by now And stopped burning rocket fuel like its koolaid,15
17,Claims to be adamantly in favor of the spirit of free speech Refuses to do philanthropy because he doesnt like someones stock ownership choices I wonder if Elon Mush is just another rich douchebag manipulating people to get what he wants,10
18,This dude is the Illusive Man from ME2 When will he get swallowed by a black hole ,6
19,Let me get this straight Elon wants to buy Twitter to ensure free speech is preservedElon proceeds to confirm an unverifiable claim from screenshots of texts posted by a 3rd party EV proponentstand up comedian Twitter account which is biased towards Elon of course because thats also what he isFollowers of Elon the general public mostly start ragging on Bill Gates for supposedly standing against EV And this is the preservation of free speech This is the equivalent of high school rumours,7
20,Gates told NYT opinion writer Kara Swisher last year Its important to say that what Elon did with Tesla is one of the greatest contributions to climate change anyones ever made And you know underestimating Elon is not a good idea,8

1,I think about this all the time  So many unique sites and information all gone forever  I could read for days on sites about local ghost stories even from my podunk nothing town  Now you search for local ghost stories and you get 10 pages of worthless links to the same old sites over and over and sites that copy those sites and so on  Its sickening to think of  It really is,614
2,Blame smartphones  It really brought in the people who would never made it online without them  They have ruined everything and continue to do so,570
3,I remember when You Tube was actually great and uncensored when it first started before Google bought them out  Then it has slowly decayed from that point on,241
4,The tale of two cities It was incredible back then as most people knew image editing and a lot of the content was usergenerated for fun vs for profit or agenda Rules in some communities were also a lot more strict which led to better content And you had uncensored communities I really miss the no politics rules that a lot of social communities had as its too culturally abrasive Ironic because I mainly participate in those communities Selfmoderation was an incredible thing and allowed  users to seek the quality of community they wanted These days it too much of an industry standard thing Reddit at least semipreserved the unique subcultures in each community Back then it felt like the funniest content ended up on the internet These days it feels like the funniest content is created to end up on the internet But back then you also had archives of multiple decades of funny things that were never seen vs now its a daytoday culture of daily fresh content It just felt a lot more genuine and so did the discussions Viewpoints were largely accepted regardless of their opinion now its just am massive groupthink simulators Its like everyone is preloaded with the same opinion these days,183
5,End of napster etc was start of the downhill,145
6,My high school teachers said anyone can put something online so you cant trust the internet Therefore you cant cite websitesBy college this had completely changed,137
7,They didnt have the algorithms and advanced AI computer programs back then too So it was much more real and nothing artificial So the front page of sites was literally the top shit90s and early 2000s was the last free open internet But i will say around 2007 2008 was a fun time when youtube was getting huge and things became really easy with computers and technology That was also the start of internet personalities like vloggers and so much more video content and music,103
8,Ive harped on about this sort of stuff for a while Reflecting on the golden era of things Whether it be sport or the state of the internet or whatever Once money makes its way into just about anything its roughly the start of the decline That and alot of nostalgia,94
9,Its because of smart phones  You had to use a computer to use the internet   The internet was unironically flooded with sub 60 IQ immigrants,86
10,This post just brought me back a little bit Fuck I miss stick death,61
11,Didnt the founder of Reddit want it to retain an egalitarian spirit of freedom and wasnt it almost libertarian leaning in the early days What happened Did they kill the guy,53
12,Early internet was amazing  Those good times will never return  Internet 20 was a corral  Internet 30 will be a straight jacket in a padded room,42
13,Web 20 treats everything as information I thought And human beings have no rights on web 20 And its an extremely hostile environment,38
14,MySpace was awesome I hated when everyone switched to Facebook which seemed so boring and unnatural,40
15,Internet was dangerous thenNow it is too safe and sterilizedThats allEvery new product game or media is just a repeat copy of the old ideas Everyone tried downloading a hack to use brain power to defeat skill grinders All creativity was slowly squeezed out by this mindset of fairness and safety The smart phones expanded this mindset by creating a consolelike experience Instead of having a full function computer you now have the tablet with apps Hard storage completely disappeared making all products quasi meaningless No one cares how much gearcurrency you have in WOW Social media like facebook made people act fake and put on heavy masks hiding their real personality Everyone has become a fake copy of the most standard accepted talking points Deviation simply leads to a hazingbullying party where everyone tells you its naughty to speak inappropriately It ended with the gamer gate incident Thats when toxic masculinity became a mainstream talking point That defeat against the original internet people will never be understood but it was the moment the internet changed forever,37
16,I also remember this fondly Not sure if TPTB didnt understand or simply werent concerned but either way there appeared to be little interferenceWe could do more to fight this Independent forums groups blogs and websites still exist and many are great We should spend a lot more time there and support them and not jump straight to YouTube FB reddit etc when starting a channel or group Also just spend less time online,32
17,I was there and I remember a moment of silence for what has been lostBut you forgot about one thing Remember AOL and the walled garden internet It too collapsed and the outside web took over  Theres always hope,31
18,I made some dope geocities pages back in the day,29
19,Miss these days,26
20,why no mention of IRC that was the reeeaaaal Wild West of the interwebs during that time period there was so much trouble to get into there lol,26
0, How is Twitter going to be different nowIt might not be No way to predict that in advance given how mercurial Musk can be Hes made comments about free speech and less moderation But hes got a reputation for silly stunts and memeing so who knowsWhat am I missingHe can do pretty much anything he wants It will be a private company and hes the majority if not sole ownerHes rich enough that he could very plausibly burn the entire thing to the ground and still be a multi billionaire if he wanted to Hes worth 250 billion although a lot of that is pledged towards other loans which is why he needed help securing funding Twitter will cost 45 billion with some of the financing provided by othersConsidering how important twitter tends to be to things like government communication this could potentially be pretty disruptive,3278
1,One of the most powerful men in the world just bought a valuable propaganda piece Might not be problem could be unfortunate,1051
2,If you dont use twitter no reason to care that much Hell even me as a twitter user dont really care that much,275
3,We dont know if it will be different or how it will be different yetPersonlly I dont care I dont use Twitter If Musk fucks it up then that is OK by me People will migrate to another platform just like what seems to be happening to Facebook,229
4,Twitter was already a toxic hellhole I dont see how it could get any worse,181
5,It hardly matters That site has been a cesspool since years theres nothing worse that could happen to it The shit show will be fun to watch from the sidelines tho,98
6,Have you seen what Zuckerberg has done to the world with FB,82
7,Its an impending doom to these people because they took their power to shut people up they didnt like for grantedNow theyre panicking because the its their platform they can do what they want weapon is pointed at them,64
8,1 This is the information age and the next war will likely be fought over its control  but maybe oil will still be the next one  idk2 2 Nobody spends 54 BILLION dollars out of the goodness so that the masses can have FREE anything speech in this caseThe question you have to ask is  what does HE get that he wasnt already getting for the cost of an account cost  nothing,47
9,Short answer we shouldnt careLong answer we shouldnt care at all,45
10,Most likely the only thing thats going to change are some issues with the site itself and not the user base What really needs to happen is a massive policy change but they probably wont do it,41
11,Ive seen many employees upset by the change for various reasonable reasons Elon has a history with how he treats employees but I havent seen many negative sentiment outside of that Most of the people I know are just memeing about it,34
12,With change always comes an impending doom Every time we get a new president people act like the world is going to end,31
13,He wants to reverse the restriction of free speech on the platform And by that I mean he thinks its okay for politicians and business and news sources to just straight up lie to people Twitter was actually censoring false information by these figures and it seems like Musk is somehow against it,22
14,The same people who said its a private company they can do as they like when Trump and other right wing voices were censored are worried that Elon will reverse that policy and make Twitter a place of actual free speech,23
15,I think were all getting wrapped up in the smoke screen of free speech Elon bought Twitter because of the commercial benefits He now owns data dating back as far as 2006 Your tweets are rich in behavioural data persona mapping brand affinity associations political affiliations public and private sexual proclivities etc and all of this is quantitatively measurable with engagement metrics location and interaction dataSimply put this data holds every one of our emotional triggers and motivators And given the scale of Twitter user base what they dont know about us they can take a pretty accurate guessThis behavioural research is now freely distributable across Elon Musks many businesses which ultimately means hes going to be extremely successful at selling you his wares The reason Elon harps on about free speech with reckless idiocy is because he wants that raw disinhibited flow of emotional reactions to more accurately target consumers Consumers of products Consumers of ideas Consumers of beliefs It has been well documented how much influence social media has on political viewsIt has nothing to do with morality or human rights  He purchased influence And that should terrify you Theres no benevolent intent here,21
16,I mean you dont have to When a super powerful man buys one of the most popular social platforms its going to cause media uproar,17
17,Twitter is pretty left wing and have been de platforming many centreright accounts for a while now and with Musk coming in the censorship will decrease as he advocates for free speechBasically the left claim they support free speech but if your free speech goes against their views they want you to be cancelled,17
18,Because now its all on him and he might decide to do something like allow all kinds of hate speech or disinformation in the name of free speech,16
19,I think right now it is all an unknown  Musk is intelligent but he at times is also an erratic manchild  I feel like he blamed twitter for his issues with the SEC when it was his own comments and tweets that caused those issuesTwitter holds some importance because it is a communication tool for individuals politicians and businesses  It is the modern equivalent of what radio was almost a century ago,14
20,I think its because he says a lot about free speech but generally behaves in a petty and vindictive way when he is displeased with someone So its pretty easy to fear that speech might be just a little more free for those that dont disagree with ElonBesides even if he makes good on his promises anyone who has ever dealt with an online forum knows that unmoderated communities devolve into kooks and trolls ruining everything,14

2,As a nonAmerican which party is antiwar,774
3,Yeah Americans are way too calm about how unabashedly evil and dangerous their right wing isLike the Conservative party in my country is more left wing than the Democratic party,474
4,Oh God I just saw Elons comic THATS NOT HOW THE OVERTON WINDOW WORKS,377
5,This is the post in questionhttpspbstwimgcommediaFRcu9TeXEAMjvTMformatjpgnamesmallx200BSo I can buy that thats how musk thought the political spectrum worked in 2008 x200BI also agree that the 2021 label is more accurate x200BBut the 2021 has always been more accurate musk just never heard of anyone left of a neoliberal and assumes that information that new to him is new information Its not He was just wrong,217
6,I can see this if the comic is a decade old or something but have you heard of VOX in Spain AfD in Germany LePen in France HungaryI mean the VOX folks literally idolize Franco an honesttogod fascist dictatorEuropeans know plenty about far right fanatics They have their own or at least have some on their doorstep,161
7,Also his post assumed that conservatives in the US have remained the same since 2008 They havent Id argue that theyve gone harder to the right than liberals have gone to the left And not only have they become more conservative theyve also become less democratic The GOP is no longer a healthy functioning conservative counterpart to the Democrats,130
8,Elon Musk is and I want to say this as kindly as I can an utter fucking idiot,71
9,Anyone have those playbooks on hand so we can see what each platform is actually about,52
10,I have had this exact conversation with many of my European friends After 2016 most of them said something similar I love the US your history your culture  everything But what in the world is happening with your people and your government,30
11,Republicans are redDemocrats are blueNeither one gives a fuck about you,12
12,The comic works with just the first 6 frames,6
13,The more I find out about America the more Im thankful I live on a different continent,6
14,Ok but like1 the US is an extremely large diverse country Many things are administered at the state level rather than the federal level because many states are larger than most European countries2 the national parties thus have very different agendas than state or local parties and theres a significant amount of comparing apples to oranges when comparing American government to European ones3 Americans on both sides of the aisle are more skeptical of government than Europeans are so yes economically the Republicans are much further right than their European and Canadian analogies4 Americans are byandlarge more religious than their European counterparts meaning that social conservatism is more popular on both sides of the aisle here but particularly on the right5 The aforementioned skeptical streak America has and the way the federal system is designed means that radical authoritarians on either wing are much less likely to seize power here and much less likely to be able to accomplish anything if they do win an election here Donald Trump had two years of both houses of Congress the Supreme Court and most state legislatures and he basically accomplished nothing legislatively during that time which is a good thing,9

17,People in Europe who vote conservative are far too fucking selfish to care about other people especially Americans In England there is literally no reason to vote for the tories no one i have spoken to has ever given me a positive reason to vote for them its always just because they dont want Labour in,3
18,European perceptions of what right and left are say 0 about how American politics have shifted Europeans are just weird,2
19,The scary thing as a European is that my country France is now following the US in this direction The last 2 presidential elections have asked me to choose between a conservative and a fascist I dont know how long Im going to be able to like my country,3
20,Well its been that way in the past but Le Pen got 42 of the vote in France the other day,2

1,He declares that Twitter must remain politically neutral and follows it up with a political cartoon that is not neutral  Its clearly suggesting the center has shifted because the left has become extreme while the right has not moved since 2008  This is anything but neutral,1323
2,I think the main issue here is the spectrum is ill defined in America Our left barely passes as centric internationally,976
3,That cartoon is literally the opposite of what has happened in the past several decades  Forty years ago mainstream parties on the right at least had the decency to pretend like they didnt want to associate with actual Nazis,546
4,At least he admits he supports the right wing nonsanity Edited because apparently the mods think the other word is problematic,296
5,Oh yeah Elon great take Im sure we all remember how the Right stayed exactly the same after Obama was elected ,213
6,The right literally tried an insurrection but sureits the Dems who are extremists  Musk can go fuck himself with a Falcon 9,146
7,Dude has this awfully fucking backwards Our left is middle right to every other developed western country,114
8,The Overton window The right is dealing with fascism and propaganda and the Democrats have been pivoting to the right to keep their donors happy You got the center existing somewhere on the right and you got the Democrats just to the right of that Of course you got Republicans way off in lala land on the right And the majority of Americans based on international standards are left of center because of the shift not represented by either party Then you got people like me who have always been on the left and are increasingly seeming more and more extreme in context of the parties but not in context of the polling,85
9,The son of an apartheidera emerald mine owner is a right wing psycho Color me shocked,80
10,This man is proof that either there is no god or that god hates humanity,51
11,Fuck this guy I dont know why anyone defends him Hes no different than our other oligarch overlords Theyre all terrible people You dont get that rich being a decent caring person,45
12,The left gave this piece of shit huge subsidies to prop up his electric car businessPlease dont run for president next Another Twitter narcissistic businessman,41
13,I hate him I hate him so fucking much,38
14,how does someone this mind numbingly stupid have any money let alone the most money of anyone alive ever,18
15,There is a very big different between being neutral and being objective Neutral is what the CNN tries to do most of the time They call everything 5050 like democrat say this republicans say that Even when one side is clearly making things up,13
16,As usual I feel like I must be taking crazy pills a la Mugatu in Zoolander Surely the left have been more consistent in their policies and the right have moved further rightIf anything the entire spectrum have shifted further right but the right wing trolls like Musk are facing more and more pushback and people that are standing up for themselves and calling them out on their bullshit They then interpret this as people being more left wing just because the world is slowly becoming a bit more civilizedBasically they want to be able to continue having all the power without any responsibility and no one questioning them and when they find the serfs are biting back they point at us in shock and call us namesBiting the hand that will never feed you I find that quite wholesome,11
17,Shift the Overton window to the right accuse the left of shifting it to the left,12
18,Pretending the Right didnt run miles further to the right in 2016 is some next level bullshit Nobody in the Democratic party is anywhere near that far left Bernie and the squad are barely left of center This dude has the political literacy of your average 4Chan teenager,10
19,Elon Musk Am I so out of touch  No it is Twitter that is wrong,8
20,Fascist propaganda  Really,9
0,I miss Trumps Twitter He could tweet literally anything and his replies would be YOURE FUCKING HITLER I HOPE YOU DIE or EVERYDAY I PRAISE GOD FOR YOU MR PRESIDENTI remember when he called Kristen Stewart a dog for cheating on Robert Pattinson,456
1,Why was Veggietales facts banned,326
2,If Musk can successfully put a dent in the bot accounts om Twitter that would be fantastic,323
3,I read that as Musks femboys,214
4,Is this a TNO reference  kill me,105
5,Finally The funny accounts back,84
6,Ok but will he buy me a McChicken,74
7,Now that an AfricanAmerican gentleman owns twitter can my bros get an nword pass,68
8,I want him to unban everyone thats ever been banned fir any reason Make it an unusable mess of bots,46
9,Stop this isnt about Donald getting unbanned this is about me getting unbanned,35
10,I just dont care,33
11,I dont have Twitter probably will never have Twitter but Veggietales Facts intrigues me,26
12,I forgot that we lost VTF,16
13,Now just need Elon to purchase Reddit,15
14,Im just here for Babylon Bee to return Musk loves that site and Twitter  it,14
15,Trump said he wont be back on Twitter,12
16,IS THAT A TNO REFERENCE,11
17,based and The New Order pilled,8
18,I cant wait to see some more Trump classics like when he said Hillary got schlonged commonly used word in politics,7
19,As foretold he shall return The greatest tweeter of all timerealdonaldtrump reinstated,6
20,More appropriate song youtubecomwatchvJ9FImc2LOr8,3
0,So all outstanding shares are guaranteed bought at the 5420 price at some future closing date rightWhats the downside of buying right now at 5200 and guaranteeing a small return 3 gain Sure beats getting my ass handed by the fed every day in other stocksEDIT Thanks all  Most of the time you dont know your ass from your hat and lose money with me all day but today I learned something,849
1,honestly insane to see,821
2,Whats the point in having fuck you money if you never say fuck you As Bobby axelrod would say,700
3,Im never trusting Reddit again lol Everyone saying this was a pump and dump actually got me thinking about buying options for the first time Thank god Im too stupid to figure out how I can setup my account to allow buying options haha,530
4,The list of things I would have laughed at if you told me 5 years ago it would happen just keeps getting longer and longer,366
5,Over  Under on how soon Trump will be tweeting againMy guess Within a month,328
6,mkevin just tweeted that twitters ceo will get a 42m check if he gets terminated after the buyout goes throughthats one hell of a golden parachute,295
7,Kind of reminds me of that Simpsons episode where Bill Gates thugs buy out Homers internet startup I reluctantly accept your proposal Thugs proceed to destroy his office,202
8,Say what you want but this was brilliantly executed on Elons part Tech stocks are currently in a world of hurt and one company after another is getting whacked after earnings But consider this timelinex200B1 SEC documents on 5 April reveal that Elon has a 9 stake in Twitter2 Twitter offers him a seat on the board in exchange for an upper limit of his stake which he first considers then rejects3 On 14 April he announces intent buy Twitter for 44 billion leaves open the question of funding  Twitter rejects this offer on technical reasons mainly the funding question4 Netflix gets absolutely destroyed after earnings on 19 April the worst in tech so far dropping by 36 within hours5 Elon secretly secures funding with a multitude of banks and provides sufficient evidence to substantiate his offer forcing the Twitter board to seriously consider this offer now6 On Saturday 23 April Elon cryptically tweets Moving on which people interpret as him abandoning the deal which at this point would get him into trouble with the SEC but he is no stranger to that7 The Twitter board realizes that they need to act now  rumor has it that Twitter will report disastrous figures on 28 April which will destroy the stock price8 Failing to agree to a deal with whoever would open them up to class action suits regarding their fiduciary duties but it is already Sunday 24 April Finding a buyer besides Musk is virtually impossible on such short notice9 Twitter is forced to negotiate a deal with Musk on Sunday evening10 Musk closes the deal for exactly the price he stated 14 April in his best and final offerIt looks like theyve been played hard here I am looking forward to Twitter earnings on Thursday and expect bad numbers Elon probably knew Now it doesnt matter much anymoreBut if their numbers are horrible and they rejected this deal for political reasons the board members could be sued into oblivion for not acting in the shareholders financial interest,178
9,We live in a simulation,162
10,rtechnology in shambles,115
11,The mad man has done it,100
12,Twitter has 217 million daily active users Buying twitter at 43 billion would mean that those daily active users would be worth 198 each Is advertising in the long run really worth that much Twitter is an old platform theres no guarantee that it doesnt go the way of myspace or digg in the coming years,65
13,Hell of a lot to spend to get that kid to stop tracking his jet,66
14,Id quite like to see Elon moments after taking the keys simply pull the plug and send twitter into the abyss That would be golden Its a complete hive of shite,56
15,Bought shares this morning and sold 2024 LEAPs at a 60 strike price lmfao Free money baby,53
16,Listening to Musks remarks about free speech makes me wonder if he truly understands why social media platforms do some of the things they doFree speech is indeed a freedom and an important one  But like all freedoms it can be abused to become quite harmful  When one freedom starts to impinge on other freedoms then something needs to give and right now we are seeing those harms from deliberate misdisinformation campaigns that are threatening the very foundations of our society like democracy,50
17,Possibly the board knows that Twitter is doing badly  once this Q result is released the stock will tank significantly They choose to accept the offer  cancel the quarterly result release,49
18,So if I own TWTR at 65 I know bought at a bad time should I be buying more right now to decrease my cost average since the shares will be paid out at 5420,40
19,Options still have value why is that Shouldnt most of them go to 0,39
20,So the richest person in the world will now control the worlds most used social media system to voice their opinions Does nobody see anything wrong with this,34

1,Ask the people on his blocked list how much of a free speech guy Elon really is,1424
2,I think believing private or corporate owned platforms such as Twitter are integral or important to the idea of Free Speech is much more dangerous to the idea of Free Speech than the trading hands of such platformsEdit grammar,721
3,I think the main thing will to bring back alt right users who were banned as well as propaganda users etc,561
4,Twitter is already a cesspool I dont understand why people even like it That said I think hell absolutely silence people he doesnt like,507
5,A healthy Internet isnt too dependent on one site Lets remember that Elon isnt buying twitter to protect free speech Hes buying it to shut down the bot that tracks his private jet,242
6,I dont get how some people can be so nonchalant Elon tweets something and the entire market is manipulated and he can pull a pump and dump Even if you dont use it it is a giant megaphone that enables a hoarding of wealth and with no restrictions its going to get worseAnd if you can use it to make billions in market tampering you can use it for other meansEdit to add some and auto correct errors,181
7,I think hes just saying its for free speech really hes trying to1 Control the media2 Make even more moneyOwning one of the biggest social media platforms gives you a ton of influence over the world Its also not going anywhere its going to make a ton of moneySure maybe Elon is going to give us all more free speech an edit button and just happily sit back while people on Twitter enjoy absolute freedom Or maybe hes going to use it to get even richer and shut down narratives that threaten him and his interestsWhat do you think the richest man in the world is more likely to do,166
8,This is just another step toward dystopiaa Billionaire obtaining sole control of one of the most famous media companies does not bide well for the future of our country,103
9,Btw this just goes to show Dude could totally put up 30 billion to end world hunger at least for a time Instead he wants to buy out a whole media corporation to stroke his ego I guess,106
10,I see it turning into a bigger cesspool than it is now his idea of free speech is letting people say anything regardless of consequences,49
11,Billionaires and freedom of any kind shouldnt be put in the same sentenceunless its their own freedom,45
12,Theres been a bunch of attempts from the right to replicate FacebookTwitter Why not one from the left No social media platform is forever see friendster and myspace,44
13,Twitter will end up contributing more to the downfall of society than YouTube Elon Musk was raised by white supremacists His Tesla factories have a culture of racism,40
14,Hard to be concerned when you know its going to happen The real question is what are we going to do about it,35
15,I feel like the freespeech warrior shtick is mostly cover so he can freely use the platform to promote his other crap,26
16,Twitter is not essential,24
17,Elon would make my day if he just dissolved it and turned it off,19
18,The revolution will not be televised organizing has to start in our own communities for it to make an impact Any real socialist action dies online regardless of who owns the platform,16
19,This is what I think I think all social media is on its next evolution which is more censorship for everyone Right wingers are walking right into their worst nightmare while praising this stuff Im not even a Christian and Elon musk just gives off some kind of anti christ figure lol Thats just me rambling but in all seriousness I think its about to get much worse but in the end it will all work itself out Everyone has to stay aware and fight back against this stuff,16
20,He will also now have a lot of data on every single Twitter user,14

1,Answer Is either massive deletion of bot accounts or people leaving twitter after Muskquisition Edit or both at the same time of course,5552
2,Answer it is most likely due to removing of bots Twitter has been notorious for allowing bots to follow verified accounts that share their preferred narratives and agendas,1408
3,Answer There are 3 viable explanations for why this is happening1 Bot purge this is the most likely one2 Twitter bug it could be a bug in the code making people lose followers or displaying incorrect follower counts3 Elon Musk buying Twitter and people quitting This isnt all that unlikely in Mark Hammills case He has 5 million followers and lost less than 02 of those other two cases are similar They lost around 02 to 05 of their followers and its not unthinkable that 0205 of the Twitter users quit over Elons aquisition Most likely its just a combination of the first and third 1500 people quitting over Elons aquisition and some bots being purged,782
4,Answer Elon has stated he plans on taking the algorithm open source and the company private Neither of those actions suggest twitter will become more profitable as a platformElon has also stated that he wants to unblock everyone However I have a feeling that once he speaks to lawyers about letting people provoke violence his platform that stance may changeHe also wants to make all users verified which destroys the bot market I expect bots make up a good portion of users on all platforms,409
5,Answer at least for Hamill its a tongue in cheek tweet to indirectly illustrate and possibly embellished for comedysatire that Musks stated operations standards for content permitted on Twitter has and will continue drive users to abandon the platform  their account Fans of Musk and Freeze Peach are mocking the threats of exodus as being analogous to the threats of Americans who warned theyd move to Canada if X happens And since Twitter will now be privately held the quarterly reports of operations including user metrics will be walled off to outsiders with the exception of any existing outside  tools that measure such metrics And thats only if NuTwitter doesnt make changes to disrupt that last part is what if not based on any rumor or reportTwitter had a duty prior to the buyout to operate Witch policies that appealed to the maximum possible volume of users to grow or at least maintain the userbase That included disrupting highly objectionable users and content Musk dislikes this and so he bought them out to make it his playground And since Twitter has long had a tough time with revenue growth the controlling interests were happy to take a windfall and move on rather than stress over how to continue to growIn the end this buyout and any negative changes will prompt a nonzero volume of users to cease use of the platform whi h will in turn reduce ad revenue from advertisers as they are no longer reaching the same audience demos or metrics which will then cause other firms to move in from Twitter for consumer engagement as the volume dwindles and so on This is already inprocess  the only question is how long will it play out,27
6,Answer all the bots being shutdown by Twitter employees,5
7,answer people are definitely quitting I didnt agree to elon fucking musk owning my data when I joined twitter cant believe anyone libertarian sees this as anything but consolidated power ripe for abuse,2

1,Happy conservatives are the surest sign of bad things,2150
2,Why does no one ever talk about how addicted these politicians are to fucking social media,1377
3,Wait until the harsh reality sets in that it wasnt always twitter banning content and users That it was the advertisers requesting and demanding this or they were going pull their ad dollars,1133
4,Strange he did not buy Truth Social,444
5,Wait until someone says something bad about Elon I cant imagine a I hate Elon Musk Twitter account staying active for any amount of time,318
6,Something tells me conservatives will use the same Free Speech argument to defend Elon reactivating Trumps account that they used against Twitter when it was originally suspended,309
7,Conservatives  he will defend free speech Elon  all users must be authenticated Conservatives  Pikachu face,272
8,So lets talk about conservative fragility Conservatives are so attuned to feeling victimized even when the scales are tipped overwhelmingly in their favor they cry that its biased against themTake TwitterConservatives constantly whine about big tech is biased against conservatives and point to Twitter banning Trump as proof Now any actual study pnasorgcontent1191e2025334119sec4 quickly finds that the Twitter algorithm massively amplifies conservative voices and suppresses liberal and leftist ones and has done so since its foundingBut there is no study in the world that you could show them that would convince them of that fact Their identity is tied up with the idea that they are persecuted they arent going to let anything as insignificant as objective observable testable reality interfere with that self imageIn fact the research showshttpspubmedncbinlmnihgov24590751 that showing them the evidence that they are wrong will just cause them to double down on the core belief,273
9,And you know when conservatives are super excited about something its usually a great idea for everyone else s,206
10,Freedom of speech indeed   Tesla earns 26 of its revenue in China   More than half of the Tesla produced is produced at the Shanghai Gigafactory   Musk appreciates the location of the Chinese authorities and business prospects in China   In this regard many questions arise Will Musk censor contents to please the Chinese government Given Musks celebration of free speech the twist could be very interesting However in my opinion this is unlikely  Social networks of adversaries in the Celestial Empire are blocked by the Great Firewall The Chinese equivalent of Twitter the Weibo WB US network has 500 million users The local population has long been under the umbrella of censorship from the CCP And in order to influence the population of Western countries Twitter alone will obviously not be enough  twtr,171
11,I think its hilarious that the GQP think they are this free speech party Meanwhile every school yard in red states are having book burnings where you cant say the word gay or black or the word race Disney literally having government used against them due to their speech that big government didnt like All this after several decades of moving legislation and court rulings to give businesses and corporations the rights to have political speech now suddenly they dont like itThe GOP and Elon Musk loves censorship they just like to be in charge of the censoring and which the truth of why they are happy about Musk buying Twitter,167
12,How come no one is talking about the fact that Musk just showed us why billionaires at least 300billionaires shouldnt exist The amount of power that he flexed in making this deal is frightening,96
13,As I said before Elon keeps touting Twitter as the Public Square and all that jazz for free speech But if Twitter REALLY is the Public Square then shouldnt it belong to the people and not 1 billionaire who can seemingly do whatever the hell he wants with it No one really seems to be asking this question just doom posting and saying how they want to leave Twitter and I feel  like its an important question to ask if people actually feel if Twitter is that important to the discussion of Free SpeechHonestly though I dont think Twitter is gonna get that much worse then it already is so I really dont understand all the doomposting about it All I really see Elon doing is just probably boosting his own cryptic tweets to game the stock market rather then just let a bunch of incels and racists run free,92
14,If Musk reinstates trump he is officially part of the coup against America January 6 hasnt failed yet people,68
15,They barely ban you for anything unless its potentially really out of hand If these people are so happy as to just say something really fucked They are just pieces of shit as human beings,49
16,Finally conservatives can say whatever they think in public s,43
17,The party whos sole intention is to further enrich and empower the extremely wealthy is happy that another billionaire now controls a massive medium of communication and can filter it to his needsWhy I never,44
18,Ecstatic for nothing As soon as one of them goes on some wild racist or violent rant which wont take long and they are moderated or banned conservatives will go right back to hating Twitter,36
19,Of course they are More than likely Musks first move after taking Twitter private will be to reinstate the account of their orangehued twiceimpeached electoral loser of a leadership figure,30
20,Heres the thing They say theres no spaces for free speech if youre a conservative Are we sure about that Or is it that your ideas are unpopular My question to any conservatives reading this is What is a conservative What is your party platform What do you stand for and whyGo ahead,26
0,Lol if you become fucked from Tiwtter changing hands you have been fucked for much longer than you think,1262
1,Twitter is already fucked,780
2,Down with echo chambers and epistemic bubbles Reddit has you covered if thats what you want though,391
3,It costs 000 for stuff like this not to affect your life whatsoever,350
4,Twitter is still an optional interaction in our lives as far as I can tell Source Have been off Twitter for 7 years,301
5,I wish that was my biggest problem lmao,145
6,Youre an idiot,131
7,Why are we fucked exactly,120
8,Aww Poor fella is sad about free speech ,90
9,Whos we And why would you care,57
10,Twitter has a comparatively tiny user base and is already a hellhole as it isElon owning it wont matter much,57
11,You were fucked when Bezos bought the Washington Post,55
12,Certified Cringepost,33
13,Twitter is toxic d it years ago Full of complaining negativity and arguments with a dose of opinionated news headlines and an occasional meme Its really not worth ruining your day seeing negativity all the time,38
14,Well theres no way he can make it worse than it already is,36
15,Wait why does this affect your life,20
16,Dale Carnegie teaches us dont stress or worry about something you have no control to change  Assess the issue determine the worst scenario and work to improve it for the betterYou have no control in the matter so either use the app or dont but stop worrying about it,15
17,I think this is awesome Fuck twitter It was a dumpster fire anyway,13
18,ITT Lots of people who dont understand the issue here,12
19,Its a win for free speech,10
20,Twitter is Facebooking itself Only old politically active boomers and GenX will use it 25 years from now,12
0,I believe he was pointing out his political stance hasnt changedthe political spectrum has changed,3236
1,damn now i understand the term i didnt leave the democratic party the democratic party left me  kinda feel bad,832
2,The liberals of the 70s would be classified as moderately conservative these daysAnd yet they call us Nazis lol,356
3,Bill Maher has essentially been saying the same thing The left have gone from crazy to batshit crazy in the last 5 years,335
4,I LOVE THISI am a centerLeft moderate turned RepublicanI voted for Obama for president in 2008  I believe in Climate change  I believe in equal rights for all I believe in reasonable regulations on most aspects of societyBut most of all I believe in American Freedom and our ConstitutionThe DemocraticProgressive party I used to understand is now so far Left I will never again vote for a Democrat  The entire Democratic party has been taken over by people with serious mental problemsThere are a lot of us Moderates in the country who dont speak up  We speak with our votes especially in swing statesI think the Democrats have ruined their party for a generation,244
5,That graphic describes my political evolution accurately as well,151
6,The left continues to get more and more far left The right has kinda stayed the same for along time now,83
7,His stances havent changed the politics haveMy current favorite idea to chew on every and I mean every reasonable progressive eventually becomes a conservative Why Because we as a society move in a progressive manner And every reasonable person sees their hopes and vision met at some point And it is at that point they realize they are happy with where we are at and they decide to conserve it,85
8,Heck the GOP have not really moved on their political stances since 2010 either If anything they moved to the left as well a bit with softening on social issues especially after Trump in 2016 or just letting issues slide,77
9,I mean an average 2008 democrat was a lot more like a 2022 conservative than a 2022 democrat,72
10,Cool Im in this picture,54
11,I empathise with this entirely When I was a teenager many people described me as a fiscally conservative Democrat who really likes guns Now such a thing is oxymoronic but it didnt used to be,40
12,After the reaction hes gotten Im not surprised He was always a centrist but now hes facing hate cancel culture and snowflakes upset about him giving everyone free and equal speech That has to be jarring and eye opening,29
13,I think this is a phenomenal its going to be more and more common for the next couple of years Lot of people realizing that the modern democratic party not represent the same things that they believe And when you look at the Democratic Leadership you have to wonder what the hell is going on,29
14,IMHO Hes saying what Bill Maher said IE the left has gone way too far left   And that has made him conservative even though he hasnt moved at all,29
15,Literally me starting around 2016,21
16,Ive never met anyone who went from Conservative to Liberal  Its ALWAYS the other way around,20
17,My political positions havent changed that much over time and I can relate to this a lot In the early 2000s I was a pot smoking atheist liberal with mixed kids Now Im a pot smoking atheist racist bigot conservative with mixed kids Still trying to figure out how but thats what I am to the current left,15
18,This also represents meI went from leaning left with basically just letting people live their lives to now more conservative for thinking 4 year olds shouldnt decide their gender It changed to quickly,14
19,Thats a very simple and accurate graphic  Love it,12
20,From the outside looking inBoth parties moved quite a bit to the extreme,10
0,I dont remember them vowing to end world hunger like Musk did,587
1,For what reason would any mega rich person stray from the standard diet of selfindulgence and conspicuous consumption,451
2,Elon Musk was the only one who promised to do it and then reneged,156
3,If you want to end world hunger youd be better off voting in some more progressive political leaders who would keep western resources companies from facilitating the looting of Africa and Asia  Countries like Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo have huge oil  gas and mineral wealth but its easier for western resource companies to pay billions into the overseas bank accounts  to the leaders than it is to ensure that the royalties stay in the countryIf the US UK and the Netherlands passed laws so that their oil companies are responsible for making sure that the oil royalties stayed in the countries would do more than Elon Musk ever could to ending world hunger,155
4,What people need to realize about the very rich is that a vast number of them are psychopaths Thats not rhetoric or hyperbole psychopathy serves CEOs very well it makes it much easier to view people as numbers and to manipulate your way to the topEnd the cults of personality surrounding the very rich and politicians Worshipping these people serves nobody except the ones being worshipped,151
5,To me Elon  just gave makes it sound like the former owners had incurred no previous cost for their ownership and that they have 44 billion of pure profit with which to go forth and do good thingsAnd I guess that the 44 billion is a one lumpsum homogeneous amount not that its spread across thousands  thousands of share holdersSo it seems a bit disingenuous and irritating but maybe I am just reading it wrong,73
6,This is either like layers of misunderstanding or a really feeble attempt to mislead peopleAlso super weird how quickly people will trip over themselves to excuse Musks obviously problematic behavior even when the criticism is very specific to that behavior,60
7,Elon also still has 180 billion left after buying Twitter to ban the bot that tracks his personal jet So he can fucking end world hunger too the twat,46
8,Thats not how that works He is buying all the shares of the company so that none is spread among approx 850million shares owned by thousands of investment companies mutual funds retirement funds and individuals,41
9,Hes 1 person lol  share holderSplural they will not have 44b if its split up you simpleton,38
10,whole lotta muskateers in this thread,12
11,Is none of the above an option,9
12,lol what what a dumb take,6
13,Not every investor is mega rich some a everyday people from all around the world that may get an extra 20 dividend out of this Anyone with shares in a NASDAQ etf will most likely get something Some people need to learn how the share market works,8
14,Do people realize that the places they want some a few people to end hunger actually have governments that collect taxes receive financial aid from WFP World Bank and other international organizations The first step to ending hunger is to hold people in those governments accountable before looking for some savior to use his billions to end world hunger,7
15,If it only costs six billion dollars why hasnt the UN just got that from its member nations  I feel like the US spends that on 1 tank or something right,6
16,You know what Forget the debating ending world hunger for just a second How about ending American hunger He could do that easy Im not saying fuck everyone else Im saying to those people who think world hunger is too big to solve with money he can absolutely do one country or at least help that he says he cares so much about But he doesnt Why He doesnt actually care He rather spend time making his own spacecraft for space tourism which wont be viable for even the mega rich until hes dead and gone,4
17,It certainly could be but human suffering is meaningless to him,4
18,Is this a weird nerd defending Elon What a goober hahaha,5
19,I think the problem is that Elon bitches about having to pay his fair share in taxes but has no problem forking over 44 billion to stroke and preserve his fragile ego,3
20,They werent the ones who said they would though,4
0,This is the new Im moving to Canada,738
1,Holy shit its been less than 12 hours are we really this far into instant gratification,701
2,,283
3,High profile Twitter usersStfu,153
4,Its literally day one of the news Welcome to Twitter,130
5,Twitter in a nutshell,106
6,Twitter is literal ass 989 of it is just teenagers and 20 somethings typing thoughts out that end up just being painfully cringe ridiculous and absolutely undeserving of being anywhere besides in the head they originally came from,107
7,1 Self important influencer celeb or journalist proclaims they are quitting 2 Individual receives more engagement than they have in 2 years to said post3 Doesnt quit because they want to reply to echochamber replies and DMs Gets into a couple fights they cant back down from too4 Has change of heart to stay so they can use their platform to continue peddling illusion of their selfordained importance,100
8,This happened today How do they know whether or not people are going to deplatform,87
9,Who cares Post dont post Nobody actually cares Life will go on,76
10,Funny that everyone was perfectly fine with China owning Tiktok and manipulating what everyone sees on there but put Elon musk in charge of Twitter and everyone goes absolutely nutsIts almost like people just get mad at whatever the media tells them to get mad at,43
11,MehI remember everyone that was moving to Canada when Cheeto man was running for president Like most of the movements we see theres a whole lot of talk and very little action,39
12,Lmao nobody cares if they  their Twitter accounts but I bet any money they wont People are so addicted to social media that they cannot stop using it Its legitimately comparable to smoking cigarettes you dont technically have any physical withdrawal symptoms but youll go insane without it,28
13,If Elon actually wants to make money for the banks foolishly loaning him 44b on Twitter hell make very few changes to the existing site formula and look for ways to better monetize itThe problem with making Twitter a platform for Free Speech by eliminating moderation which appears to be what he wants to do is that a bunch of other sites have already tried doing that exact thing and have failed to crack beyond niche players in the social media space 4chan had this idea back in 2003 Gab and Parler have tried to do a more spiffy modern approach in the last decadeWhere are they now Yes they all still exist and still have users but theyre not breaking into the mainstream The reason is simple Most sensiblyminded people stay away from them and the unsensiblyminded people are looking for a place they can argue with the sensiblyminded not an echo chamber circlejerk of hate speechUsers claim to want free speech in all things but the reality is that the overwhelming majority of users want some reasonable guardrails and limits on what can be posted on the platform Allowing too much of the filth to creep in will drive away most of the userbase and probably most of the engineers who are actually responsible for making the site work Some of which will probably form their own competitor to Twitter that will take Twitters place in the market,22
14,This is probably one of the most insignificant and meaningless articles I have read about this Nobody cares if you are coming or going from twitter If you dont want to be on twitter dont be on twitter Nobody is forcing you to stay Nobody is forcing you to go Manufacturing a crisis where there is none,22
15,Twitter will always be absolute chaos but thats what happens when you give stupid people and smart people an equal platform for speech Plus 1000s of bots specifically made to push an agendaBut this is America and Ill never give up my right to free speech if I can help it so it is what it is Id rather have a full platform for free speech then to selectively choose what to censor PS It always best to just  all social media apps but look at me posting on a social media app This is the world,9
16,Dont like it then make your own twitter,6
17,I didnt use Twitter before and doubt I will use it after this I dont think even Elon Musk has the resources to clean up that garbage heap,8
18,,6
19,Its only been a few hours you say youre house is on fire but its not a pile of ashes curious,8
20,I dont get it Why does the left hate Elon all of a sudden Is it just because hes become the wealthiest man Im legitimately asking not trying to stir anything,10

4,Meanwhile Russians have to call their commanders on cellphones that bounce off of Ukrainian cell towers and get intercepted by an enemy that speaks the same language,87
5,Elon does all these good things like make starlink help Ukraine make electric cars and all these jealous haters who havent done anything in their lives keep hating on him Its crazy,40
6,Mr Musk got plenty of Ukrainian soul in his heart,32

1,Mark Cuban was the son of an auto factory worker Though rare it does happen,133
2,Name one person that is entirely self made Ill wait Being self made is bullshit We all get help from people around us Some of us start in more privileged situations and end up making more impact because of it  But the idea that you did it all by yourself is an illusion Who built the road youre driving your self made life on,119
3,But BOOTSTRAPS,70
4,Still the growth they made is paramount There are many examples where Daddys money could not buy shitThese are highly capitalistic exploitive manipulative success hungry people,30
5,Read malcolm gladwells Outliersthe idea of a self made man is more or less bullshit and even weirder almost all super rich people from certain eras have identical back stories right down to their birthdays,26
6,Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates actually had remarkable starts despite having some help I can think of a few others who started with a lot more and achieved a lot less The real problem is the system they were able to rig and exploit to become mega billionaires Even if a billionaire started from nothing there should be no billionaires at all,18
7,Nothing about them is selfmade They are trash,15
8,A Tesla employee told me that the Elon Musk apartheid story was fake lol he literally said you should get your information from better sources I asked him like what corporate propaganda Lol,10
9,Fucking baldilocks looking all smug,9
10,I wish my dad was a millionaire so I could self make a billion dollars,5
11,Elon musks father had shares in an emerald mine in Zambia actually not South Africa,3
12,How about Steve Jobs,2
13,Warren Buffetts father was not a powerful congressman He served a couple terms lost an election was eventually reelected Mostly he was a modestly successful investor in Nebraska Its not like he had influence to use to hook his son up with some sweet deals,2

0,Shaun King is a charlatan who coopts progressive movements to make moneyThe mother of Tamir Race striaght up called him out for making money off her sons deathHe is almost the last person media should be using as a litmus test for political conversations His goal is money and fame Fuck him and fuck his grifts,989
1,Calling Shaun king a liberal is the most incorrect part of this whole article,548
2,Shaun king is a fake progressive who just supports who pays him,547
3,Fox News must be telling us this out of kindness and not to stoke race war among their shithead base,246
4,He left he wasnt banned Im sure everyone circlejerking about this being due to musk censorship realizes that right,160
5,d,121

7,I like the conspiracy theory that he isnt actually black like that woman from Washington,70
8,That time Shaun d his Twitter account but then realized he couldnt live without it His Twitter is live currently Hes a fraud,63
9,I dont like Musk but thats ridiculous,51
10,There are insufferable losers from all sides of the political spectrum on Twitter Im sure his account will be quickly backfilled,41
11,Good I cant stand him All he does is post bullshit that keeps everything about race and Im black,40
12,Hes just salty cause Elon Musk is an actual African American,37
13,I bet a big part of the Twitter funding came from Peter Theil httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiPeterThielHe is Musks former partner at PayPal and he is a major white supremacist Everyone should be alarmed,29
14,,31
15,Isnt Shaun King a white guy,24
16,This dude is a moron,22
17,That would sound suspiciousbut coming from Fox News that seems ok with false election claims it means nothing,22

1,The bots and trollfarms are piling in,707
2,I use Twitter to follow cartoonists and porn How will I be affected,530
3,Theyre removing the algorithms,238
4,How does this make any sense The only thing I see is that it proves twitters old bias,160
5,The amount of trolls replying to tweets criticizing Musk this week is absolutely insane,60
6,People on twitter can finally blame a specific person for their problems,65
7,I find it amazing how the left thinks media was a level playing fieldEdit If you disagree I would love to see any information on a liberal who was censored on twitter Meanwhile there are hundreds of thousands of conservatives who were even daily,57
8,Been noticing lot of activity on Republican social media which was virtually silent from 2020 No its not russian bots or shills  most of the new people are reacting heavily for inflation based posts Someone in GOP is designing short content based on inflation  that will appeal to younger audience  the algorithms seem to pick up more of them,21

13,Probably enthusiasm among the political rightPolicy changed didnt happen yet,5
14,imo its going to be really great when Republicans realize Musk is a businessman and not just a conservative grifter and his idea of free speech probably is not what they want it to be,4
15,Oh when the botscome marching in oh when the bots come marching innnnnm oh Lord i want to be in that number when the bots come marching in ,1
16,IMO this is the result of Twitter engineers low key removing codealgorithms that limited the reach of centrists and conservatives Its akin to trying to flush all of your drug business inventory down the toilet in the limited time between the 1st knock on the door and the sound of the authorities kicking their way into your apartment,0
17,Republicans who have always been able to exist on Twitter and have existed on Twitter celebrating that they can have free speech Idiots,3

6,that shit arse platform isnt even worth half a billionfucking Twatter shit,169
7,Great Two Billionaire megalomaniac narcissists will now own pretty much all social media Zuck and Elon laughing hard at the plebs right now This is actually a little scary imo,133
8,What exactly is the conspiracy here,91
9,So a guy known for censoring his critics and employees is suddenly the savior that will bring back free speech for the right Lmao This is controlled opposition Twitter will start censoring any truth about the wealthy class waging economic war on everyone else Theyll keep the smoothebrains on the left and right fighting each other while they are stepping on both of their necks,83
10,I dont know why conservatives are cheering this on Further consolidation of technologycommunication in the hands of the already elite ruling class is not a good thing for anyone,64
11,How is a business transaction a conspiracy,40
12,Predictions1 Elon Musk buys Twitter A bunch of people say theyre leaving but the only people who actually do are progressives who were barely on twitter to begin with They mostly go back to Tumblr which is already having a bit of a renaissance anyway 2 Elon Musk restores Trumps twitter account This time there really is a notable movement of lefties and normies to other sites but its drowned out by the return of Pepe the Frog avatars and the altright3 Elon Musk announces that twitter will dramatically reduce moderation The Pepes begin spamming Jewish journalists with photoshops of their families being put in ovens which was a rampant problem in Twitter a few years ago and the reason they started cracking down to begin with4 These journalists begin leaving twitter mostly to Substack 5 People who were on twitter mainly to follow journalists begin quitting not in protest but just because twitter is no longer giving them what they want anymore6 Concurrently Twitter becomes a cryptonft hub chasing away artists who hate NFTs which is nearly all of them because NFTs are mostly stolen art7 A chain reaction occurs where liberals artists and normies quit twitter because the liberals artists and normies they were following quit twitter Twitter increasingly gets a conservative reputation progressives move to Tumblr and possibly new social media sites like Mastodon 8 Twitter never dies but slowly loses cultural and political relevance as its userbase shrinks and it turns into another GabTruth except with porn,44
13,SS This is a pretty big deal If he sticks to his guns that is He should start by unbanning every user excluding ones who posted illegal content of course Live updates here  independentcouktechtwitterelonmuskstockbuyingb2064847html,21
14,Ever since I started using Reddit as a social media three days ago I cant see why I would make any social media account on any platform for a while,22
15,,17
16,Wonder how it will change now,16
17,Why are we even supposed to give half a fuck what these rich pricks waste their money on Honestly How does this change our everyday life It doesnt so why even fixate on it,11
18,Aaaaaaaaand here comes the digital IDs  lol,12
19,I dont really trust Musk but If he really goes through with the no censorship thingshadow or otherwise I will get a Twitter account,7
20,The best thing he could do is purge bots from the site That alone would dramatically change the tone of the site,9
0,I wonder if the people who made these comments will be banned from Twitter in the near future,340
1,come on guys lets hear him out why dont we put him in an underground tunnel during a hurricane so we can see his genius plan in action,233
2,Did he  I cant find the tweet on his page,155
3,Who ever said Elon was any kind of engineer His daddy owned an emerald mine in apartheid South Africa that is the extent of his talent,127
4,In other news the leading Hyperloop tech company in the US abruptly laid off half of its staff and is pivoting to cargo transport for Arab oil barons due in part to the fact that they havent figured out how to seal the vacuum chamber at passenger train stops,98
5,I dont like how underground aquifers are shorting my sniff pure ideology about how tunnels solve everything So Im going to make a hostile take over to buy all the porous rock and sediment so I can force them to restructure  Elon Musk Probably,81
6,flashbacks to New Yorks subways during the 2021 hurricane,61
7,so he knows what a subway and even uses it as an example yet builds the vegas loop 100pure idiot,54
8,God I hope Twitter dies from this,29
9,Hyperloop is a replacement for private jets Its basically a super train Fast exclusive elite and ferociously expensiveSo if he gets hyperloops he can put that kid on Twitter tracking his planes down,12
10,Its just like in Pokmon where ground is known for its ability to beat water,10
11,The last time a major hurricane hit Florida 12 people died in a nursing home because the AC went out Now imagine being in a hypertube with no power,9
12,Musk was born on third and thinks that was his second home run of the at bat,10
13,I mean if water would get into your vacuum tube it would be kinda fucked and not be able to do its job anyway So water ingress shouldnt be a problem at that point youll probably have to shut down the line and conduct repairs An earthquake howeverAnyway hyperloop is about as viable for mass transportation as maglevs There is a reason why Germany sold that tech they developed on it to China its simply to inefficient to be viable for anything other than being a prestige object,9
14,Hyperloop tunnels would be sealed to maintain a vacuum and engineered to deal with ground water so technically he is right However the engineering plant used to maintain the vacuum might be susceptible to hurricanes if not rigorously engineeredThe problem with hyperloop is more that the faster you go the further apart each train or vehicle has to be and above a certain speed capacity thereby goes down Stopping distances are not linear with velocityThe constant obsession with speed is counterproductive and creates its own demand as it encourages decentralisation but on the other hand hyperloop would be good for cities as compared to motorways and highways,10
15,Im half convinced he wants to by Twitter solely to stop people from bullying him,10
16,Why would Elon build a kidsized submarine if tunnels dont fill with water,6
17,Considering Elon dont know what a train is,4
18,Also tunnels are great to build in places with earthquakes,4
19,So close and yet so far,3
20,If this man ever heard there was a hurricane coming his way he would be the first to fly tf out of there how tf he gon know how water and tunnels interact,3
0,Funny cuz its not satire,296
1,Experts now believe that with 44 billion the government couldve used it to feed about a dozen people and sent a ton of foreign aid to corrupt local warlords in BotswanaOkay this is overall pretty funny but Botswana is like the one subSaharan African country that isnt run by warlords Its actually growing like 10 GDP per year,277
2,I see the Bee is reporting on real news now,99
3,They also continually accuse him of not paying taxes when he paid the most taxes in history He even posted proof and Elizabeth Warren ignored it,67
4,Someone realized the left is going down in a dumpster fire and wants to save face,62
5,I like how the UN wanted to steal 6 billion from him to somehow solve world hunger 6 billion  say a billion hungry people is a one time payment of 6povThe US government stole 11 billion from him last year Why didnt they solve world hunger,33
6,MORE IMPORTANTLY    This country has spent more than 35 TRILLION over 58 years on the war on poverty yet the poverty rate remains about the same as when it began     People need to realize that throwing money at a problem doesnt solve it,24
7,The Bee has shifted from satire to news in comedy form,18
8,This isnt satire,16
9,This is a thing of true beauty,14
10,Elon Musk buying Twitter is going to force 44 billion worth of capital gains options and paper gains to be realized immediately He just gave the government another giant tax payment this time paid by other people,8
11,Too bad Musk cant just buy the government out  I would feel better with him running things than those ass clowns,7
12,Yeah the liberals in California with their infinite wisdom would use that 44 Billion to build covered carports on a vacant lot and claim they solved the homeless problem,5
13,tragic that he cannot be US president,2
14,The Babylon Bee at this point is more of a prophetic scripture than comedy,2
15,how much is that for each voting parliament member,1
16,d,2
17,Literally cant believe this is from The Bee  Its 100 real ffs,1
18,Well yeah theyd rather confiscate it and then funnel it to people who share their ideals who then fund their campaign,1
19,A rare miss from the Bee,1
20,Whine whine whine,1
0,Ive never really loved him either Like the other day I was playing the FF7 port on my phone and I get a pop up ad about musk buying Twitter right at a crucial moment in the game and it totally fucked up my flow Like dude I dont care,844
1,To be fair he probably didnt love her either,790
2,I know were supposed to hate everything about her now but did everybody here fall in love with everybody you dated  I know I didnt,502
3,Its okay hell just buy her,235
4,Isnt Elon one of her witnesses later in the trial The only reason this may be relevant is that the man has a notoriously fragile ego and is acting pretty erratic on his own right now so being embarrassed by this may cause him to back off on his support of her,198
5,d,100
6,And this is news why,66
7,We all have that in common with her,53
8, Carino responded by saying You can avoid this by not dating uberfamous peopleI thought Elon was the teslafamous guy,51
9,Cool I never really loved him either Someone report on that,41
10,Jesus himself couldnt love Elon Musk It would be more concerning if she did love him,46
11,Why is this even a discussion Who gives a shit,32
12,Weirdly I dont blame her for this one,28
13,I doubt she has ever loved anyone but herself,33
14,What A beautiful woman wasnt really in love what a rich bipedal amphibian and was only there for the money Unheard of,26
15,He is unlovable Even the warmest kindest person alive wouldnt find anything in this hungry ghost to appreciate Everybody around him is only there because of his wealth and while that may provide great isolation for his life quiet moments and the tall shadow that eventually comes to claim him will always remind him he is alone in the universe of love and bonds because he is a twat,24
16,Oh shit I missed the memo that said we were supposed to be in love with every person we ever dated I really liked some but love Pfft,15
17,This is supposed to make us hate her He fucking sucks,14
18,Wait is itThis is the most useless headline in 2022,12
19,Duh Elon is gross A friend of mine works at Tesla and says he has poor hygiene is fat pasty and smells,13
20,Even as much of a POS spouse beater Amber is makes sense that no one could really love Elon,17
0,Cant wait until his platform totally fails and goes out of business Bonus will be Devin Nunes leaving Congress for the CEO gig,553
1,Devin Nunes must be SO proud of his decision,507
2,Who cares it was a grift They never intended to create a functioning social media Trump never even used it It was about email list building and stealing startup money,436
3,The SPAC market is well and truly fucked anyway TrumpMusk aside,394
4,So we have a handful of billionaires control the flow of the majority of information across the internet  Im sure this will work out just fine,171
5,Twitter is nearly a toilet now Itll reach fulltoilet status once it becomes a free speech platform for misinformation,165
6,I still believe and will take downvotes but Trump getting unblocked will be a gift to democrats,72
7,What happens if everyone leaves Twitter  Better question might be is anyone REALLY using Twitter anymore,63
8,DWAC has been down for the past few months It was always a pump and dump,54
9,Another failed Trump businesshe has to hold some sort of record,24
10,Donald Trump and Elon Musk are the same person,23
11,Trusk Mump  theyre both the same to me,23
12,If Trump is allowed on TWTR again lot of users are going to quit along with TWTR employees Hell I wouldnt be surprised if employees are already thinking about quitting since it is now a private company and under Elon,18
13,Aww  these poor SPAC speculators  I personally think many of them just wanted a way to help line their heros pockets but that would be unusual a Republican giving something to somebody else without expecting anything in returnyeah it cant be that,12
14,Oligarchs gonna oligarch,11
15,Yes and the people in DWACStock keep buying shares although their list of losses so far is astronomicalTheres going to be a lot of people going to have a rude awakening,10
16,Twitter will turn into a toxic cesspool that will turn off the average user and scare off advertisers ,9
17,What a load of trash  that Truth Social of Trumps Its neither truthful nor social,5
18,He was out of a job anyways because of redistricting but Im sure he could have worked for Fox or OAN Either way F that douche,4
19,TIL what a SPAC is  Id never even seen the acronym until this thread,3
20,I guess every cloud has a silver lining,3

8,To the top with you ,70
9,d,66
10,So what youre saying is buy the dip If they only raise 025 on the next rate increase wont that make people bullish Because they are expecting a fairly hawkish Fed with the possibility of 05 or 075 rate hike,35
11,VIX futures are in backwardation What I mean by that is all contracts with nearest expirations are priced higher than contracts expiring at a later date This indicates funds are front loading their volatility hedges now instead of later However this signal occurs with sector rotations and we happen to be at the end of a tech oneAnother thing I want to note are the recent prints on gamma exposure GEX and dark pool buys DIX For the past few days GEX has been consistently in the negative millions while DIX appeared to show lower volumes in dark pool activity I recall seeing the same patterns just days before the covid crash EDIT GEXDIX are data points from SqueezeMetrics,38

0,Joe Rogan fans sucking a rich persons dick and being hypocritesSay it aint so,1538
1,This is why I find it hilarious that there are people out there who seriously believe that Elon Musk will bring back free speech to Twitter,1251
2,Free speech is when you say something I agree with and the more I agree the more protected it should be,826
3,Hes been doing this a long time Didnt he get into it with Larry Ellison early onThis article mentioned is from 2016 theguardiancomtechnology2016feb03elonmuskbloggerteslamotorsmodelxIf you have a problem with Musks actions the time is well past to act on those feelings,635
4,Private companies shouldnt be able to censor free speech But Elons can because its a private company that can do what it wantsRules for thee not for me,498
5,The knots the comments are tying themselves into in order to claim this isnt hypocritical are of Gordian proportions,467
6, Freedom of speech isnt just fuck around theres also a find out to itOkay but maybe it is hypocritical for someone to pretend to care about free speech while being a vindictive weirdo that actively punish people who are critical of him,368
7,Now thats Musks idea of free speech I wish I could do that kiss your fingers thing when something is just perfectly rich,191
8,Elon Musk the free speech absolutist who wanted the kid posting his public flight plan information on twitter shutdown Just another hypocritical tech bro libertarian,137
9,some users feel that punishing a blogger for a bad review is hypocriticalit isthe other side claims that Tesla as a private company can do what they wantThey canI dont see why people die on these hills it is what it is who cares this much,134
10,Its a private company Twitter does the same thing So either Tesla is against free speech or Twitter is justified in banning trump and babylon bee Cant have it both ways guys,132
11,Can we all agree to retire fuck around and find out No Ok never mind,112
12,Every once in a while I have to rant about the complexity of content moderation at scale since its an issue that is widely misunderstood not just by rich people but elected representatives and judges tasked to make rulings on such mattersThe core of my opinion comes from Techdirt techdirtcom20191120masnicksimpossibilitytheoremcontentmoderationscaleisimpossibletodowell specifically Mike Masnicks argument that its impossible to do moderation well at scale As an example of the problem imagine if Twitter has a system that sorts out 9999 of the tweets good ones are freely posted Offensive or dangerous ones are correctly flagged and processed It gets billions of new posts per day which means 10000 per billion are either a false positive getting  without cause or wrongfully factchecked or whatever or a false negative offending people without proper reviewYes Twitter and Elon Musk are private individuals and as such theyre not ruled by the first amendment But Twitter is ruled by secton 230httpsenwikipediaorgwikiSection230 which allows it to moderate user content as the company sees fit This is a good thing because whenever the government carves out an exception and it has it creates a chilling effect on online content not just on twitter but on social media generally which is one of the reasons porn sex work support programs and LGBT support pages have disappeared in the last decade Generally if a certain kind of content might create a liability the platforms will err to the side of censorshipHence it is also why I get permabanned from subreddits for no clear cause and with no explanation Because right now theres just no good way to moderate and often its left to humans making human decisions Its why Facebook has had fiascos with breastfeeding mothers and fine art featuring boobies There are no consistent opinions on where everything fits and meanwhile some people upload videos of cats getting tortured and its cruel to human employees to be subjected to that Its a messAnd in current events its why law enforcement are often found blasting copyrighted music while they are up to no good in the hopes that digital music screening will obstruct videos of them on social media CyberpunkNot moderating at all will get you all the penis pill ads and Nigerian princes you could ever want and thats before the botnet furryfutaporn DDOS attacks and Kpop DDOS attacks that have made the news regarding platforms like Parler Gettr and Truth Social They decided to join in the social media race and much like Trumps encounter with fixing the medical care crisis found it is complicated And this is before getting into all the sneaky darknet shit like human trafficking CSAM trade drug trade and terrorgroup intercell signalingSo I suspect Musk is going to find taking control of Twitter much like Zik Zak trying to take control of Network 23 Sure he can decide to shift policy around and theres plenty to shift around He may also look to intercept traffic of personal enemies or punish people for talking ill of him but in doing so hes going to devalue that 43 billionplus he invested in Twitter and so being an asshole on social media will now literally cost himIn fact its costing him already as the Musk buyout is serving as a last straw for plenty of Twitteraddicts looking to shutter their accounts and walk away For some Musk is actually doing a serviceMeanwhile Facebook and Alphabet are watching with popcorn in hand teams on the standby to implement a new Twitterclone where reasonable people can hate on billionaires in peaceIn the meantime denying service to a Tesla customer based on a blog piece might be a violation of state public accommodations laws kinda like the Masterpiece Cakeshop debacle in which the US Supreme Court had to weave a very tight ruling to let the Christian Cake Man deny service to gays for being gay Besides which petty shit like that is bad businessTLDR Social media moderation is super complicated and love of free speech doesnt have much to say about it But if Elon Musk extends his pettiness to Twitter policy hes going to be putting his 43 billion in Twitter stock at risk Meanwhile Facebook and Alphabet would both be glad to offer a Twitter alternative that isnt controlled by a petty rich guyEdits Markup clarity passEdit 20220428 Grammar and cleanup pass,114
13,Legally can you do it YesBut you can also legally walk around naked in your own homeEither way dick move,92
14,Calling people by their biological names is not a violation of their TOS Talking about a legitimate news story is not a violation of the tos Try againDidnt know that our names were encoded in our DNA TIL,82
15,I used to like looking at that sub out of morbid curiosity but now every time I do I can actually feel myself getting dumber Joe Rogan fans constantly jerk themselves off about how they see through the bullshit even though most of them have the same exact centrist normie opinions that you see anywhere else and think theyre so smart and nuanced for having them A lot of them still deny that Joe has made a noticeable turn to the right bringing up the fact that hes had leftleaning people on the show while ignoring the actual words that are coming out of his mouth Its always the same old bullshit taking everything said by the left or Democrats and extrapolating it to its most absurd and dangerous implications while not saying a goddamn thing about the actual crazy bullshit that comes from the right and conflating random leftists that hold no actual power with Republicans who hold office But his fans are so brainpoisoned by the culture war that they think theyre immune to that they do the same thing the MSM they hate so much does all the time by acting like Republicans are ever acting in good faith and deserve to be taken seriously I wish the media was as unfair to the right as a lot of these people think it is,70
16,Elon musk is one of those kids I hung out with as a kid and knew they should never get any kind of power but yet I felt sorry for them because they were absolute losers and didnt see what they did wrong and wanted people to like them especially the bullies Back then I was blinded by that pity and wanted to help them out These days I get no energy because it always ends with them wanting to kill off my other friend for their insecurities and bad faith sense of freedom Seeing this shit in full force is crippling me mentally,28
17,I really miss Rogan talking about jacked chimpanzees and DMT instead of conspiracy theories and DMT,22
18,We all know that Elon means free speech for wacko right wingers Not free speech to criticize him track his jet unionize at his businesses,22
19,In case anyone was wondering this happened years ago The critical post was written in 2015httpsmediumcomsalsopdearelonmuskyoushouldbeashamedofyourselfca3d266882a41jpmd9f8f and the Tesla order was reported canceled in early 2016 businessinsidercomelonmuskpersonallycancelsbloggerteslaorder20162 So people are digging up old dirt on Muskwhich makes this more interesting than if it had happened recently,12
20,Where is Wikileaks guy,11
0,Yes because 4chan is a publicly owned corporation and not currently privately owned by some individual and certainly not by some random Japanese person called Nishimura,391
1,4chan invented the free world,138
2,Id be happy if Elon bought this shithole of a website,80
3,When Elon saw the breadth of his domain he wept for there were no more internets to conquer,52
4,Musk describes himself as a liberal  What Democrats used to be before they got bullied into craven obedience by their radicals  So I wonder if he will rally the remaining liberal Democrats to revolt against and overthrow the radicals especially after a catastrophic electionThe radicals tried to overthrow the liberals at the convention of 1968 and failed  They tried again and succeeded at the convention in 1972 and have controlled the party since  But with screwballs and losers at the helm the party is ripe for counterrevolution,31
5,You kidding He bought twitter cause of how biased and censoring it is because of how its against free speech No way will he want to do something with 4 chan 4 chan is free speech,14
6,The cries of the woke and libtards when they get told muh private company can do whatever it wants and just build your own twitter is just beautiful,1
7,Honestly Twitter is basically just 4chan but with worse people,9
8,Its moot Always has been,4

16,Looks like a cuck sounds like a cuck Anon I got bad news for you,1

2,You have to beat Elon Musk in a space race to get your account back,157
3,Elon needs to buy Jagex next costs almost nothing to him then preinstall OSRS and RS3 on every Tesla,83
4,First you have to buy whatever stockcoin Elon is manipulating that week,16
5,Might get a faster reply,13
6,He should buy runescape next,10

0,Report comments from those who obviously came here to start trouble and stir the pot with no intent to participate in good faithPeople should be able to have discussions on a topic without it going overboard We dont care who you like or dislike just discuss maturely,1
1,There was a time when a short on Tesla was a bet against Elon Musk But somewhere it became a reasonable short just on valuation alone and I dont think Musk would disagree with thatHowever asking someone to collaborate with you when you have a massive bet hoping that the most significant thing they do on fails is a bit disingenuous,803
2,Grabbing my popcorn for the mainstream subs comments on this news Already saw a comment about how Microsoft Teams does more for the environment than Tesla and other twists on how Tesla isnt environmentally friendly,246
3,Bill Gates in The Little Short Coming to an AMC theater near you,247
4,Should Elon be pointing out the fact that Gates is out of shape  Seems like pot calling the kettle black no,176
5,If I found out someone was betting my company would do worse I probably wouldnt want to work with that person either,137
6,Billionaire dramawho cares,102
7,,61
8,He is CURRENTLY shorting the stock after being asked about it already in the media See a video a month ago where he wouldnt talk about his investments He CONTINUES to SHORT the stock Not a great look for Bill and the good he is doing No surprise Elon doesnt want to team up,39
9,Whats with Elons ridiculous child is responsive comparing Bill Gates to a pregnant woman Heck even Elon is out of shape Its just pointless that makes Elon look like a dumbass Hes obviously a smart person so I dont get why he does that,31
10,I cant imagine how out of touch you have to be to short someones company while also asking them for money There is literally no company on earth doing more to combat climate change yet Bill shorts it I believe he also waited until the Taycan to buy an EV Thats fine but he clearly isnt a fan of Tesla and Elon so is it a shock Elon said no,21
11,I love my Tesla Its a well engineered product But I often wish that Musk would just shut up,15
12,Musk doesnt need Gates,15
13,Didnt Bill Gates get divorced after his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein came to light,15
14,It would have been awkward if the text bubbles were blue,13
15,I dont know why Im surprised Bill is a green bubble ,14
16,Half a Billion dollars to both Elon Musk and Bill Gates is like the average person losing a few 100 on a risky investment Dont get why Elon is so upset lol,11
17,When is this fool not crying about something Hes like a teenager in high school Its so annoying,10
18,Musk is such a manchild,4
19,Elon is taking it personally even though hes said himself Tesla stock is higher than it probably should be didnt he,4
20,A short on Tesla isnt wanting Tesla to fail its betting that the Tesla stock is overvalued which it absolutely is Only Elon takes it so personally because he has time and time again proved he has a massive ego and maturity of a child,2

13,How does someone even come to this conclusion,24

15,Sounds like a fill fledged genius sic,21
16,Ive dealt with misconceptions but nothing like this Jesus ChristSincerelySomeone on the spectrum with two degrees a decent job and successful personal relationships,23
17,I would call this person scum but that seems offensive to scum,20
18,All against Elon buying twitter but this is literally terrible,20
19,Whats hilarious is the lack of self awareness in his post Hes belittling a group for their inability to deal with a said reality while he himself is overreacting to someone he doesnt like legally purchasing a companyComplaining about change by saying someone changing the thing is abject to change is a complete oxymoron LOLOL,18

20,The shareholders couldnt vote as there was a flooded toilet in the building next door,5
0,Uhoh You posted a negative thing about Elon musk on Reddit Time to get mega downvoted by idiots who think hes the next Jesus Christ,229
1,I sell useless crap invented by other people,117
2,great sbub but id change one thing musk hasnt invented a single thing not one hes a pro at taking credit for other hard working peoples work,64
3,whats the original,20
4,I mean is the stuff he invests in he doesnt invent anything actually useless though I kind of beg to differ there,20
5,People are so salty about Twitter its hilarious,16
6,He doesnt invent anything though He name is on 3 patents one of which is the Tesla exclusionary charging cables,7
7,Someone here cares a bit too much about a billionaire,4
8,Earnest question has he genuinely done absolutely nothing good Not poking fun at anyone critical of him I just want to learn because Im not that knowledgeable about the whole topic so I wanna hear about both the bad and the good hes done if any I know his name is always mentioned alongside PayPal SpaceX Tesla and that Hyperloop thing but thats all I know Is he genuinely the most awful person on earth or is it his online Tweets the way he says stuff and the fact that hes a billionaire that makes him an easy target to punch up to Is he bad good or somewhere in the middle Is he a good person with faults a terrible person thats basically Satan or a goodishbadish person who deserves criticism but the internet goes overboard with it I honestly dont know Id love to hear what peoples opinions are I usually hear people either praise him to high heavens like a saint or slam him like hes Satan himself but I rarely ever get views from inbetween with both praise and criticism at the same time I notice people always seem to feel strongly in one direction or the other when it comes to Elon,5
9,I take credit for others inventing useless crap,2
10,He doesnt even invent things lmao he buys brands and pretends he started them see Tesla,2
11,Yeah but he makes memes so hes so based s,1
12,I think its kinda funny that Elon is just like an edgy teenager with way too much money its just really entertaining to see what hell do next,1
13,Maybe the Twitter platform can be a bit less shit,1
14,1  1,1
15,He hasnt invented anythingThough I will say this he does know how to hire engineers,1
16,EV  useless Okay,1
17,are these all quotes from him it seems like something hed say lmao,0
18,The only issue I have with this post is that I believe Elon actually does have some mental stuff going on so making fun of his face is in bad taste,-3
19,This is the part where right wing douchebags come and call you a hater and jealous,-4
20,Yeah he does like Twitter,-6

1,Last week Obama saying at Stanford that there should be more government censorship of social media  internet search to prevent the spread of toxic information like climate skeptics and the opinions of people who dont trust Dr Fauci and now thisIt seems theyre really I mean really not fond of Musk taking over Twitter and turning it into a privately held company I wonder what makes this case so special that the majority of the mainstream sphere are coming out against it Im sure its not just about free speech,716
2,News came out in the Pfizer financial release statements basically saying their vaccine potentially could not pass regulatory muster and there are unknown side effects that could negatively affect the commercialization of their other products So if I say the Covid19 vaccine sucks its literally the same thing Pfizer just said But on Twitter Id get banned for saying it,137
3,Remember when Trump talked about this,95
4,Ive said it for ten years before their control of social media was obvious this tool that has half the world as dailey active users can be utilized to pressure those in power by meaningfully putting important issues under a microscope and gauging public opinion 1000x more effectively than voting for bought out representatives Now that their monopoly of propaganda and brainwashing which has been optimized to do so is in danger they will go to war to keep it from inversely being used to decentralize power,96
5,There will come a point in time when people will feel the need to move to encrypted anonymous social platforms on blockchain and feel free to talk about whatever they want to talk about Thats when the internet as people know it will become obsoleteA lot of people are already using matrixhttpsmatrixorg to create small communities,54
6,d,46
7,Privately held company,33
8,Submission Statement There can be little doubt that the same people who have monopolized the MSM and social media also control the White House An objective uncensored MSM would have ended their attempt to replace democracy with oligarchy decades ago,32
9,d,19
10,Whats amazing is I just spent a good long while scrolling through new and hot filters of Reddit world news and not a single mention of this takeover  No matter where you stand on twitter or Elona its definitely world news and in a big way,14
11,Dude theyre worried about Trump,16
12,Democrats are the main globalists and in order to be a globalist they have to be antiAmerican Never vote Democrat,12
13,If he gives Trump back his account I might buy hes for real about free speech,12
14,The White House continues to advocate for revoking Section 230Since when has the Biden White House advocated for revoking Section 230  Trump did and the Dems were completely against it  Ive never heard anyone in the Biden White House say they want to revoke Section 230 so is Reuters just straight up lying or what,13
15,rip Elon I give him five years till he gets in a car wreck,7
16,Wait you guys think Musk is not a Globalist Lol,8
17,Hope to see them eat that section if only,4
18,Maybe if the government and media werent such shameful liars we wouldnt have to worry about what other outlets had to sayThis is a trust issue not a statutory one,5
19,Does this buy Twitter credibility again Im interested in seeing,5
20,Hes going to implement digital ID Thats all Nothing to worry about s Everything else is just theatre Yall really think Musks all about the greater good What exactly are the existing 1800 satellites for Probably controlling drones and whatnot remotely Oh already happening Now what about kill switch Furthermore he already has received approval for additional 12000 satellites This guys literally doing their work to fucking setup the ultimate surveillance system Its literally the same play all over again Divide and conquer Thats it Sadly people again fall for this BS Has anyone of those praising him for whatever reason actually looked up his views on mRNA AI transhumanism He doesnt fucking disagree but simply uses another way to persuade people into this technocracy from which hes going to profit even more  Good luck with that and God bless yall,6

1,So Musk reads The Babylon Bee He is worse than I thought,758
2,Its funny he considers himself a free speech absolutist considering how often he attempts to shut down any criticism of himself businessinsidercomfreespeechabsolutistelonmuskcensorsemployeescritics20223amp,462
3,It was because of thetrain,254
4,The Freeze Peach crowd gives away the game once again Help help they are censoring conservative ideasWhat You mean they are saying you cant talk about limited government About Second Amendment rightsNo not those onesThen which conservative ideas exactlyYou know the ones  ,188
5,Its like Musk is going down the conservative rabbit hole that middle schoolers fall into,183
6,He just keeps getting more and more insufferable,118
7,So he bought twitter to unban the shittiest comedy in the history of mankindAmazing reason I guess he must personally like it Now i have to add Has shitty sense of humor to the list of reasons he sucks,78
8,Absolutely disgusting behavior Things just keep getting worse,46
9,Bullying people online without consequences is necessary in a functionning democracy,47
10,I still dont understand the appeal of Twitter in the first place Reddit is all I can handle and its a cesspool in itself,43
11,So he just wants to spout a bunch of transphobic stuff because his ex is with Chelsea manning,37
12,Dude has been INSUFFERABLE since he bombed on SNL,27
13,Elon musk is quite possibly the most cringy man on earth,26
14,Its gonna be like the scene from Ghostbusters when they pulled the plug on the ghost container,25
15,Because of the trojan,23
16,I liked Musk more when he was still able to convincingly present himself as a cross between a technohippy space pirate and a Bond villainReal life revealing him to be a massive wanker cut from the same massive wanker cloth as all massive wanker billionaires with a power complex is disappointing,25
17,Honestly my take on this If Elon decides to do anything at all and he probably will its either going to have no impact at all or be a disaster Either way when his failure happens after a long line of documented and well observed failures already He and his army of Thoughtless NPC Incels Will blame the left and transpeople Hohum,22
18,Elon doesnt give a fuck about free speech By reinstating certain conservatives he will simply be adding to the divisiveness in this country He needs us yelling at each other so that he does not have to contend with our pitchforks coming for the worlds largest wealth hoarderEdit damn your autocorrect,17
19,Hes doing this bc it will make the base buy Teslas in mass Yknowbuying an electric car to own the libs,16
20,He doesnt believe in free speech  He will censor people who he doesnt like,15

1,A lot of weirdo Elon fanboys in here pretending he wasnt sent an itemized bill that he ignored,143
2,Elon is like MGK to me I always see him involuntarily,91
3,Math aside Id love if he bought it just to  it Then went to Facebook bought it and did the same thing,80
4,Nearly everything is more important than Twitter,60
5,The megarich are not your friends and dont give the first shit about you Remember this every time Daddy Elon does something typical of the megarich and yet still is portrayed as one of the people,54
6,I never wanna hear anything about how billionaires actually dont have a lot of money because it isnt liquid or we ever again,42
7,This is something I never understood They treat him like hes some superhero  hes literally just another capitalist turned semioligarchist He doesnt know or care about any of us  It just got revealed he fucked Amber Heard while she was still married to Johnny Depp too  who genuinely as a good person does that,26
8,Ironically the WFP raised 84 billion that same year yet we still have world hunger Whether youre a Musk fan or not theres a lot of corruption there  wfporgfunding2020,13
9,A grown man talking about haters tells me everything I need to know,9
10,Why dont the people who sold it to him take the 44B and end world hunger 7 times,8
11,All this just so he can let Trump get back on Twitter and mess with the next election currying favor with the GOP,8
12,All of our governments working together could end world hunger overnight but you all are relying on the mega rich to do it For a group of people who demand more government programs and assistance to help the greater good you all are really good at holding everyone but your governments accountable to accomplish that This is more of a logical failure than DeSantis vs Disney clown game going on in the political cesspool in the US,6
13,yeah well twwtter is still garbage,4
14,But dont we remember when we were told he was just like us Its said he sleeps on a mattress with holes on it totally relatable s,3
15,All the money insert billionaire spent on insert billionaire shit could have been spent on much more important things,4
16,It should count for election finance,3
17,Or maybe we could spend less on the pentagon 3 billion a day,3
18,I dont like Elon and I believe he could have used that money to be far more helpful to humanity but the 6bn plan wouldnt even feed all the hungry people for a year 44bn wouldnt even feed everyone let alone end world hunger,2
19,Only thing more of a joke are the people believing in this false Messiah,2
20,I hope after the money changes hands twitter majestically implodes,2
0,mans just bitter his girlfriend left him for a trans woman ,874
1,How dare sites make their users follow the ToC and not use the platform to harass and spread hate speech Literally censorship I should be able to determine what rules every platform has,702
2,All this just because he got cucked by a trans woman,248
3,If Elon removes moderation like he was saying he would Twitter is going to become even more of a fucking cesspool than it already is,197
4,Hes balding and malding that grimes is getting kisses from a trans woman lmao,188
5,I made a Twitter account a bit ago and I feel like itll already be gone real soon,153
6,Wait really,116
7,Musk is upset that his exwife is dating a trans woman also,103
8,Is this true that he actually bought Twitter over a transphobic account getting suspended,102
9,Theres no word malicious enough while still being infantile to describe how I feel about Musk Like hes not Putin but hes also just a huge fucking twat,85
10,lmfao Just because Grimes is dating a trans woman,71
11,HES UPSET THAT A TRANS WOMAN STOLE HIS GIRLFRIEND I GUARANTEE IT,72
12,I think its gross someone can have so much money they just decide I dont like your rules and buy an entire platform just to change said rulesWhat an asshole,65
13,Of course thats why apparently trans folks have it too easy according to these freaks,44
14,Bro what do you mean me saying a slur for 10 minutes straight isnt the peak of comedy,39
15,Cant wait for elon to legalise harrassing minorities  j,39
16,Im curious why did Twitter allow themselves to be acquired by Musk Arent they contradicting themselves Why did they approve of it,28
17,Thats wow thats just DEPLORABLE On every level Evan a Christian level,22
18,I thought satire was supposed to be funny ,20
19,And the first article of the new TOS will be that Grimes has to date me again,17
20,That last sentence on the Wikipedia article bitch go back to school The first amendment applies only to the government You can talk out your ass all day about the minorities you hate but at the end of the day I can still punch you in the mouth for it and not infringe on your rights Freedom of speech is not freedom of consequences,11

1,Short sellers We win when the company is delistedMusk buys and takes company privateShort sellers wait No not like that,955
2,Its hard to know with such faulty data and reporting But the idea of SHFs shootings themselves in the foot made me go from six to Midnight,388
3,Elon hates the SEC hates shfs hates other billionaires Who better to have on your side  Not saying hes on our side but he does have asburgers and we are retarded apes  I truly believe he has a plan to finish shfs for good,127
4,How does this translate for Twitter investors If Elon is offering 5420 per share and is taking it private even if theres short sellers that need to close their position and buy back shares it wont theoretically cause a squeeze right Since price is capped at 5420,115
5,d,112
6,Or The evil Hf is short twitter and buying the company force shorts to clover positions  Elon hate shorting,91
7,Sooooo Marge for some SHF and MOASS for usIll take that for my Bias,80
8,Starting to fantasize that there is a secret alliance  Billionaires have declared war on each other like rival mob families  Only one family has the hearts and minds of the citizens though,68
9,This fits your narrative nicely httpstwittercomjackstatus1518772754782187520s20,69
10,Im pretty sus of everyone here sucking Elons dick He hasnt really done anything for GME,20
11,This is exactly how I read it as  People look at what is happening around us there are short squeezes everywhere and these idiotic short sellers cannot even contain it  We see mini and massive squeezes from so many different tickers  Elon buying Twitter was an example of a fuck you to shortsellers and regulatory organizations  Yes regulatory organizations because if you have been here since January 2021 you would know how fucked up the SEC NSCC DTCC etc is  We all know how Elon feels about the SEC  I mean the list goes on with the pure corruption of the whole system  Its a huge cesspool that has been leeching off of hand earned workers in which is YOU,19
12,Imagine if they decide buy back shares to make it more expensive thus double fucking them selves   FUCKING DUMB STORMTROOPERS,17
13,Where is the evidence that Twitter has a high unreported SI,14
14,You mean kinda like when Dole Food went private  bloombergquintcomviewdolefoodhadtoomanyshares,10
15,Pulte sold his TWTR shares though,8
16,Serious ELI5 question  what happens to the short contracts when a company is taken private in this way,8
17,I actually think he is refering to RC,5
18,So something Ive never understood from a practical standpoint is the claims that predatory short sellers like Citadel and co Via PFOF and their MM designation are  able to create fake shares essentially to artificially drive the price down are therefore going to be making money left and right But doesnt that imply the share prices of these equities are going down For the past 10 years most equities have been going up unless they time it perfectly,5
19,What if musk is showing us what would happen to the shorts once we DRS every share  effectively privately owned by APES and insiders,5

4,Man Elon is a cool MF at times love that Machiavellian sense of humor he has I also love watching the controllers loose their collective shit about loosing control  Oh this next few months is gonna be nuts,163
5,The fact that the left constantly tries to silence people who disagree is truly disgusting,107
6,I almost want to get twitter just to see the meltdown,92
7,Dear AOCThe Burden of proof lies with the prosecution You have made a claim that there has been an explosion of hate crimes Prove it When you fail to do so please be prepared to admit to the world that you are a liar fraud hypocrite and an utterly worthless human being that brings no value to any other human on this planet,82
8,God I hope this is real it made me LOL,75
9,Libs are complaining about a billionaire owning Twitter but billionaires own all the other social media,63
10,Hate crimesLol,57
11,Im so glad twitter exists Im so glad all our leaders spend their time on twitter spats instead of improving anyones lives in any way Im glad the world is addicted to a platform that literally makes it impossible to express any complex thought Super glad twitter exists,42
12,,33
13,This is really the worst hill for the left to pick to die on Opposing freedom of speech and supporting censorship of your political rivals Pathetic Just goes to show that they know their platform is such garbage they have zero chance without almost complete control of the narrative,26
14,Im ded   dude the comments on Twitter are goldHe single handedly ended the drought with 11 inches of liberal tears tonight in CaliforniaLmao,24

3,And the sea was filled with liberal tears,75
4,I wish this was real Great edit though,35
5,Trump reinstatement is going to be the main event after a long line of others are reinstated ,24
6,Best meme Ive seen in a while,24
7,Elons reaction was sooo good Seems about right to me,26
8,I really wish there was just a mass unban for at least previously verified users and then those who were banned who werent verified could reapply to be unbanned or something Doubt itll ever happen no matter who owns Twitter but such action would immediately get people more plugged in,14
9,Epic lulz,11
10,But for real Elon will probably reinstate Alex right,11
11,The future is now senile old man,8

14,Fuckin A,6
15,Waaaay too fuckin funny,5
16,Thank you to whoever made this edit ,4
17,The far left dont have the ability to not be offended much like Elon and Joe in this clip Now that twitter enployeeshe looked like she just shit her pants a bit,4
18,Stupid headline I was yelling about this in happiness I hate everything And lol ,3
19,Twitter is a leftist garbage dump They ban you for nothing,3
20,Abortion has to go away like the milkman,3
0,d,1078
1,Imagine having 45 billion dollars that you are willing to burn for the sake of the future of civilization and then using it to buy TwitterLike genuinely go touch grass,1069
2,Genuinely dont have an opinion on this,644
3,Prepare for the barrage of NYT opeds about how this is the end of the world,606
4,But what about the karma farming hot takes on rWhitePeopleTwitterWhere will those users go and what will happen to Jeff Tiedrich,355
5,This is good for bitcoin,293
6,Should I be upset about this I know very few people who use twitter and whenever I log in its just journalists pundits and politicians arguing with each other The people who seem the most upset also strike me as incredibly selfimportant,249
7,Im excited about this as a person who believes Twitter should be shuttered as the cancer it is I see three great possibilities hereTwitter becomes an unmoderated free speech zone regular well regular for Twitter people get tired of shitposters Nazis and propagandists and leave thus beginning the Twitter death spiral Elons people exercise some degree of moderation and suddenly the Very Online right doesnt have leftists to blame anymore Elons cult of personality is tarnished and people wake up to the fact that he doesnt care anything at all about them The right wing and left wing starts to bail out thus beginning the Twitter death spiral Elon and his buddies succeed in having Twitter treated as a utility instead of a publishing platform and the feds regulate the living hell out of content that used to skate by when it was a publisher no pseudonyms rules against obscene content and interstate threats etc thus beginning the Twitter death spiral,141
8,I feel okay about this actually because theres a decent chance he runs this thing into the ground In a roundabout unintentional way Elon might finally kill twitter This is a net good for humanity,144
9,I DONT WANT TWITTER REFUGEES ON REDDIT I d my twitter account last month for a reason,135
10,I wonder how much money Trump spent on Truth SocialImagine being a sitting congressman resigning to be CEO of a new conservative platform because Twitter sucks and then some guy just buys Twitter and all conservatives run back to the company Lol,133
11,My prediction is that Elon Musk thinks this will be easy It will not be he will eventually get bored but not after making things worse then he will bail or basically turn Twitter into something strikingly similar to what it is nowwhich is to say a total mess and kind of a net negative overall,127
12,Now Elon can finally pump and dump crypto without repercussions his second favorite pastime as he pleasesEdit added erroneously missing word due to fat fingers,119
13,He enacts a one dollar subscription and you immediately see Russian troll and bot accounts get dIve only heard rumors of him wanting to do this but I think it would be a good thing,120
14,Now you conservatives dont know what the hell to think,96
15,Rose twitter in shambles,89
16,On the one hand I dont give a shit about Musk or Twitter or the idiots who use TwitterOn the other hand theyre a big stupid mob and I dont like one idiot having the power to point them at things,79
17,The most admirable thing about Musk is when he genuinely seems to want to push humanity into the future via engineering advancements such as electric cars commercial space travel satellite internet etcTwtitter does absolutely nothing to advance humanity as a culture or a species It is disappointing to seem him waste his time on it,65
18,Twitters a private company they can do what they like people in shambles,59
19,Trumps back Lol Good on the board for conning Elon into buying them though,57
20,If he were to take it out back and shoot it he would be a national hero,48

2,if he buys it as a private person wouldt that make it one of the biggest purchases anyone has ever made  not a company merging or buying another one but a person doing so,421
3,Watch Musk buy TWTR just to ban the kid tracking his plane and then immediately take the company public again,171
4,Doesnt Twitter have earnings soon  I saw some telehead on CNBC saying that their earnings will probably suck which weakens their position Welp that kinda blows for the board But their lack of effort in bettering the platform kinda shot themselves in the foot,160
5,May be recent bloodbath of tech stocks and recession on doorstep has opened the brains of Twitter board Elons offer is way too generous,107

9,Musk cultists are something else,46
10,Game Blouses,47
11,Remember when the Twitter put buyers and short sellers were so cocksure a week or two ago,49
12,Get ready to hear the REEEEing of the word oligarch from the perpetually aggrieved,31
13,The tantrums I will see on TikTok and on subsequent tons of tweets are going to be so much awesome imagine 1 million memes by next week Itll be glorious,28
14,What happens if you have shares at higher then 5420 Serious question,31
15,rnews is already crying about this saying theyre going to do harm to democracy and free speech by unbanning users and uncensoring contentWAT,17
16,Still not expecting this to be completed,15
17,Elon stands up for free speech Unless it involves union organization or people making fun of him,13
18,He blocks union talk in his own companyand we are to think he will influence Twitter for the betterment of free speech Not so sure,12
19,I like this timeline,12
20,Russian government accounts banned first week,9
0,Is he six,590
1,all these idiots are just proving that their claims of being censored are bullshit lmao,367
2,100 in his head this guy thinks he and elon are friends,335
3,Ive never been on Twitter but Im pretty sure there was never a time when you couldnt say that,192
4,Say it with me folks freedom of speech does not mean freedom from reaction,174
5,Its ok Conservatives will have their freak out Then someone will say something stupid Then Twitter will do what Twitter does the conservative will get fired All the conservatives will freak out start to turn on Elon Elon will say but this is free speech Conservatives will still be confused because they cant admit they misunderstood cancel culture in the first place Corporate America cares about 1 thing and 1 thing only their bottom line And if firing a shit employee for saying something stupid on Twitter could give their bottom line a 1 boost for 1 quarter theyll fucking fire that guy Stuff like this always blows up in conservatives faces Its only a matter of time,122
6,He can laugh now but it wont be so funny when his Twitter account gets suspended for not retweeting enough of Elons posts,47
7,Lmao youre not shadowbanned you just have a dumb ass opinion,31
8,Wow so brave,26
9,Ive heard that there is a man with a penis out there and a woman with a vaginaGlad to hear confirmation,23
10,I think thats a satire post,17
11,Fear Whats he scared of,15
12,I actually agree with him Im sure somewhere theres A man that has a penis and A woman who has a vagina Havent check myself but Im sure theyre out there,15
13,I mean men do have penises and women do have vaginas Men also have vaginas and women also have penises Men and women have indeterminate genitalia too All different kinds of people,15
14,This is actually a great move as Elon owning Twitter doesnt mean people will face no consequences for their tweetsSo so many people have lost their jobs for the dumb racist bigoted sexist stuff theyve said on Twitter in the past so not censoring them just makes it more likely for their social media history to catch up to them in the futureThe trash takes itself out basically,10
15,You know what would be fun If Elon just shut Twitter down completelyJust  it all,12
16,Kindergarten cop,9
17,damn didnt know adesanya gave him cte that bad,8
18,No no no males have a penis and females have a vagina,7
19,These jello brains are gonna be real deflated when they realize Elon isnt the ally they think he is and they still get banned for breaking Twitter ToS,6
20,Man Costa has really been hit in the head too much Worst of all the dudebros of the MMA fandom eat his troll takes up like candy,8

1,Should be interesting to see internal emails on how the platform tried to hinder or help political candidates over the last decade,359
2,Man these folks are real fuckin scared that the other side will have the opportunity to do what theyve been doing for a decade at this point,204
3,SS Elon Musk today said the quiet part out loud Twitter suppressed a story by the NYP with incredible potential of influencing the outcome of the 2020 election He further added the story was factual,91
4,The house of cards built upon falsity duplicity and suppression is going to collapse in a free fall Just a reminder Truth shall prevail,70
5,If you listen closely you can hear Saagar still coming I love Saagar dude is great but man is he gonna tell errrybody about how Elon told him he was right,43
6,People who get their news from Twitter and base that on who they will vote for should not be allowed to vote,28
7,Props to Saagar Enjeti for prompting Elons informative responseSaagar is a host of Breaking Points,23
8,Did these crying adults commit jail level crimes for Twatter,18
9,,18
10,Elon is A globalist think about how the guy in the process of launching starlink a completely self sufficient global satellite  wifi network and he bought Twitter This is operation mocking bird ,15
11,A man who tosses worms in the river isnt necessarily a friend of the fish All the fish who take him for a friend who think the worms has no hook in it usually end up in the frying pan  X,14
12,Lol If a tweet is enough evidence of change youre setting yourself up for big disappointment,12
13,Oh no guys guys guys guys  Dont trust Elon hes not OUR friend Hes controlled opposition Look at my daily scheduled schizo collage of Elon and Saturn and Maxwell and 666 Clearly he is part of the cult they are playing 10D chess on all of us We are le smarter Digital ID Brain chips Literally the antiChrist Christbros  Guys guys guys seriously stahp Be demoralized give up come vent here and assume its all worthless Dont do anything of value EVER  glow,6
14,Dear Elon Musk Please sponsor the RC Drift empire that Im building Thanks,5
15,Elon just wants Trump to give him the Tesla papers his uncle stole from Teslas safe ,5
16,To start what we have been dealing with for the past seven years is a hostile take over of free speech by fascist in business suits Every major social media hub has made to bend to the will of a clench of protofacists operating out of homeland security and the DNC The fact that these platforms could silence a sitting president is certainly proof enough if not for the ten times I was booted from twitterfacebook and instagram for expressing my own opinions on Vaccines politics and US interventionism No company should be able to censor speech for any reason It is one thing to moderate violent or caustic behavior it is another to shut down people for their opinions There should be no example of a company that can go around the rights of the US citizenry there should be a law spelling this out succinctly No one and no corporation is above the law Nor should they be able to change th laws of the land on a social platform I am weary of Musk because of his extreme wealth but He has not made many moves that I disagree with in this sense I do not care for his nuralink crap or his notions of going to Mars But this is certainly a gem,3
17,USA needs to impeach the fraudulent Dems get Trump back in office to negotiate a Russia Ukraine peace deal like he did in the Middle East between Israel and the Arabs Hes good at that The world is walking straight to nuclear obliteration if Biden and these people are not stoped,4
18,Im seriously waiting for the news story to break that current Twitter employees are in counseling with PTSD because their new boss believes in freedom of speech You know its going to happen The thin skinned fascists that they are,4
19,she should be fired,2
20,Elons got the power,1

1,I thought it was the right who hated the rich paying taxes Why are they suddenly flipping the script,507
2,I dont care that Republicans got rid of Disneys tax exempt thing but they did it over a harmless press release so if we are talking about people being triggered maybe get out of the glass house first,453
3,Its pretty funny that conservatives just take a billionaires word he will bring free speech without any evidence but deny the piles of evidence the vaccine is effective,152
4,Oh no a giant multibillion dollar company has to actually contribute by paying taxes Woe is me im so angry now s,130
5,Elon Musk just wants to further manipulate the stock market He does not give a shit about you and your speechDisney wont be paying more taxes they should but the people who live near the park will,124
6,1 Twitter never had free speech theyre not required to2 They actually made Disney pay LESS cause now state taxes will go into the services Disney originally paid for on their own with those in Osceola and Orange counties picking up a tax increase,48
7,Musk is greedy,40
8,Why do they think liberals who want to tax the rich give a shit about Disney paying taxes,36
9,Im so so tempted to open an account on Parler or whatever Trumps counterfeit FB  is and see how much free speech they allow on there I bet not one factual article I post would stay for a moment Which IMHO is fine Thats their call to make for their platform It just makes it not a Free Speech platform,33
10,1 Nobody cares that Disney has to pay taxes Thats a good thing done for a very wrong reason2 I wonder how much free speech will be brought back to twitter There is a reason why even Truth Social and Gab have terms of service and arent popular In any case I barelye ver used Twitter so I dont really care about it one way or the other,23
11,Isnt that why musk is buying Twitter On top of being jealous of Bezos pet media outlet I guess,23
12,But you know what would really trigger me  Forcing other mega corporation to pay their taxes Nothing would make me angrier I am shaking just thinking about it I might just DIE if rich people also had to Thatd be the end of The Left Please dont,22
13,Holy FUCK these people are morons Free speech means nothing on social media Also good that Disney is payinh taxes What a shithead,13
14,The ratio of republicans claiming leftists are upset by musk buying Twitter and actual leftists vocalizing disdain is about 1001 I keep seeing republicans claim leftists are triggered but Im not seeing any triggered leftists maybe Im just looking in the wrong places,12
15,Disney was already paying taxes Now they get to not pay to maintain their roads sewers powerlines fire station canals Like the county is taking on over a billion dollar debt because of this Its a way to hurt Orange county One of the few blue counties in the state,9
16,Pretty sure Florida is now on the hook for a billion dollars in debt that Disney was going to pay and loses out on 100 million annually that was collected in general taxes from the district that no longer exists cnbccom20220421disneyspecialdistrictfloridataxpayerscouldfacea1billiondebtbombifdissolvedhtmlThe special district deal didnt give them tax free status They are the largest tax payer in Florida What it did do was allow them to operate as though they were their own citycounty They provided for the local services like fire department and whatnot Those will also have to be replaced with services from surrounding counties,10
17,So this means Elon is going to pay his taxes too right,7
18,Muskrat is going to use Twitter to pull even more money from his fans and Disney will continue to be treated better than they deserve,7
19,When will they understand that the first amendment only protects them from the government,7
20,Its wild to me that they think we are up in arms because Disney has to pay more taxes Especially since it wont be Disney paying them anyway I want EVERY corporation paying more taxes but I also dont want the state to single out those that disagree with them for that particular treatment,6

17,Has Elon even said hed unban accounts like Trump or Babylon Bee Or is that just wishful thinking as you know based or not Elon is a business man at the end of the day,20
18,Awesome Theres going to be a lot of salt shed today and I can not wait,19
19,Oh no Free speech,17
20,Elon is going to do a full audit of emailscommunications to see how infected the company has been by social Justice warriors I cant wait to see whats revealed as long as the censors havent wiped their computers,14
0,Washington Post owned by Jeff Bezos Thats kinda what billionaires do They buy stuff,267
1,Warren needs to first hold Nancy Pelosi and other politicians accountable for insider trading They clearly play by a different set of rulesEdit This comment obviously touched a nerve I know Warren is pushing for stock trading reform and Id like to point out that Warren only started pushing for these reforms after Nancy Pelosis trading became a meme on rwallstreetbets and a news reporter called out Nancy during a live conference Its not just Nancy that plays by a different set of rules How is it that 20 politicians beat the stock market in 2021 when only 3 hedge funds managed to do so I dont like her pointing fingers at billionaires when her own colleagues both on the left and the right have dirt on their hands,121
2,First part of bill all federal legislators and family members are exempt from wealth tax,110
3,Replace the word billionaire with politician and it still fits We need accountability across the board from those in poverty all the way to billionaires and people in DC Instead of a wealth tax for certain people what if we instituted a flat federal tax for all No loopholes no cutbacks one flat rate,45
4,She pretended to be a Native American in order to get into Harvard  If she is against it Im for it,32
5,Did she say this on Twitter,29
6,Oh no Twitter wont be a leftwing echo chamber anymore Big brother must stop thisElizabeth Warren,23
7,Imagine if she campaigned on this instead of trying to claim Bernie Sanders is sexist,22
8,Warren got more than 400000 for her work as a Harvard Law School professor in 2010 and 2011 Across those two years she taught two classes Elizabeth Warren Net Worth is 67 Million Forbes 2022httpscaknowledgecomelizabethwarrennetworthforbes,23
9,What a Moron What big tech company isnt owned by a billionaire Also how can anyone take her seriously after she lied about being Native American to steal a job at Harvard from an actual minority,21
10,She tweeted itfacepalm,20
11,Senators and congressmen are worse,17
12,Shes a fraud herself,18
13,Really Now LolI wonder if congress and the senate should have private interest and stocks,14
14,We need to stop Elon so that we can continue censoring things that are critical of democrats,13
15,Putting faith in Billionaires to act in the best interest of average people is laughably naive One would have better luck finding an honest cheerleader coach at a Strip club,12
16,When is the left going to callout thier leaders for claiming democracy needs censorship Its not democracy if a component is censorship,6
17,Plays by a different set of rulesSays the woman who claimed to be Native American to get into Harvard Law then bragged she was the first one,5
18,I am absolutely loving the meltdown that leftists and establishment democrats are having about the fact that they no longer control Twitter,7
19, You mean like dominion everything owned by bezos and gatesLike seriously Shes just worked up because its not one of her preferred billionaires,5

3,Is this a menu,46
4,Turns out bootstraps are really fucking expensive,36
5,And as far as I know Warren Buffet is the only one who actively attributes his success to good luck He talks about winning the ovarian lottery simply being born in the right place at the right time to welloff parents Makes a huge differenceSome of the others were just in the right place at the right time marketwise Amazons rise is amazing but you cant act like Bezos had some master plan He sold books out of his garage Now his company owns like half the internet There was no clear line from A to B there but he did make good decisions along the way Ill give him that and AFAIK Amazon didnt do anything terribly unethical until the last decadeGates was a shrewd businessman and if you want to praise him for duping IBM into one of the worst business deals in history I wont even argue He saw something IBM didnt and he leveraged that to great effect But every step of the way his company was unethical and lucky The list of Microsofts illegal anticompetitive behavior is long and infuriating but most of it predates the average Redditors birth so its largely forgotten here,22
6,Can we tax these guys out of the billionaire bracket,10
7,Im not necessarily saying they should all end the same way but as a thought experiment,9
8,So basically everyone here has daddy issues,5
9,Hey lets not be sexist Some of them had rich mommies too s,4
10,To be fair to Elon he didnt get money from his parents for business ventures He got a good upbringing and schooling but beyond that he just did it the old fashioned way  by exploiting the working class,5
11,To be fair they all did work extraordinarily hard and each of them are legitimately brilliant but the narrative around them is flawed and definitely gives people the wrong perception of how society works each of them were kind of a right person in the right place kinda thing,5
12,getting startup capitol in 6 figues isnt what makes Jeff Bezos evil Thats just business Its modest compared to the millions people in tech got in venture cap from 2000 to  idk a little before the internet stopped making money Its the decades of workers rights abuses tax dodges and environmental blights he used to build his empire,4
13,The United States has one of the lowest social mobility indexes in the developed world The American dream is one of the biggest lies in the whole history,4
14,How do I become the rich daddy,3
15,The rich get richer,3
16,Is there anyone more worthless in society than a billionaire,2
17,The emerald mine is just a fun myth he did not get his wealth from some emerald mine However he still does get his money from slave labour due to the immense amount of cobalt his car batteries need,2
18,Elons family had money but the emerald mine was in independent Zambia not apartheid South Africa and his dad was only part owner as far as the limited anecdotes mentionNot that I give two hits about Elon but please attack him with facts not bogus internet memes,2
19,A million dollar loanNobody makes it on their ownWithout a million dollar loanYoull reap what youve sownFrom a million dollar loanCall your father on the phoneAnd get that million dollar loan,1

8,Thats what he said the last time no Maybe he buys like another company and sells but not for twitter,5
9,Hahaha yeah sure what is he going to have another Twitter pole to ask if he should sell again Because last time he did that he already had been planning on selling for months at least,5
10,Elon effectively rotating out of Tesla and into Twitter is the kind of genius trade people on here make Now that he owns the company he should set it so that whenever you create a Twitter account hes automatically added as a connection Tom 20 if you will,4
11,Sells 100billion to buy twitter only uses half of it,5

8,Wow some people really need some real struggle in their life,15
9,I love elon,16
10,His smile explains everything he doesnt give a f about those dumbasses,12
11,At this point Im neutral on Elon He gave us much to love hes showing us how much of a jerk he can be too Its another human being after all,9
12,Those screams of rage almost therapeutic ,8
13,This subreddit gives me hope in humanity,7
14,Nothing says outrage at Elon like posting that rage to Twitter,5
15,Im just gonnascreen record this and post it on my snap heres my award,2
16,Would love to be there the day he uses these online rants as a means to fire every last one of them Get rid of all the dead weight,3
17,For Twitter to deserve public trust it must be politically neutral which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equallyThose who thought that Elon bought Twitter to own the libtards are going to be so disappointed,3
18,Genius,2
19,BLACKROCK doesnt like other billionaires like him to have access to billions of people with media content It puts elites on edge that their propaganda may not survive,2
20,Lol,2
0,Honestly dipped out of the traditional political system over the past few years Parties are everything George Washington warned us about in his farewell speech and everything he said would happen has or is happening x200BHowever political parties may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominionx200BThe alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities is itself a frightful despotism But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotismx200BLet me now warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party The common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration It agitates the community with illfounded jealousies and false alarms kindles the animosity of one part against another In governments purely elective it is a spirit not to be encouragedx200BReject parties Embrace virtue,276
1,Same here I voted for Obama and used to lean left The left went absolutely insane began advocating for authoritarianism which was a failed experiment as shown throughout the 20th century and antifree speech and I ran away as fast as I could,151
2,I think this graphic has it wrong It is the line that is moving not the person People are just getting more polarized than ever before in history The right is full of crazies and the left is full of crazies They both think theyre correct and the other side is wrong but in reality they are both batshit crazy and out of touch with reality  Global warming is real Cultural appropriation does not exist and is an imaginary construct in American culturepolitics  I believe in the right to bear arms Just dont be a fucking dimwit trying to make a political statement by opencarrying AR15s or M4s Donald Trump was an absolute idiot and too incompetent to run a business let alone a country  Capitalism is in general a good economic system if kept in check by regulatory laws and effective social programs I think a mixed economy is the most effective  Not all cops are racist black people haters and most police use of force with black individuals is justified just as it is with white individuals One of the few cases where a cop clearly overstepped was with George Floyd Other cases I cant speak on but the media has a habit of always painting cops as the bad guy before getting the facts  Freedom of speech is a right offered by the government but private companies can make whatever decisions they want regarding censorship Elon wanting to change Twitter to value free speech more is okay and people dont need to lose their fucking minds and act like howler monkeys because he wants to change things upIts like both the right and left are just trying to one up each other all the time and further polarizing themselves Yall are losing your fucking grips,57
3,The Overton window,41
4,Elon Musk Apologies for the typo,33
5,yep progressive  conservative are relative terms,8
6,In my world you have to run as fast as you possibly can just to stay in the same place  Queen of hearts Alice in wonderland I think Fyi Queen of hearts is ruler of wonderland which is the archetypal chaos dimension,6
7,I already edited this  httpsimgurcomaDbjLQEK,5
8,The left has always been like this its just more well known now more people understand what those on the hard right have been saying for 100 years,7
9,Whats dangerous is that despite being deranged and far left they think themselves moderate and therefore by that base level contrast anyone to the right is a facist,5
10,This describes my political views and understanding as well I thought itd be harder to explain somehow but this sums it all pretty much clearly,2
11,Damn I was looking for this exact graphic earlier this week Thanks for posting it,4
12,The fact that Elon posted this gives me hope that he actually does understand the problem And that he will actually turn Twitter into a better platform not just use it for his own personal interest,4
13,This is extremely fitting,4
14,This is what Ive been saying for a long time Im a lifelong independent But mostly you could have categorized my views as being slightly center left 10 years ago I believe the field we were all standing on shifted beneath our feet and we all ended up moving just by standing still Most people were not paying attention and are slowly figuring it out For years I would see people say Joe Rogan is on the right Jordan Peterson is on the right Bret Weinstein Sam Harris Glenn Greenwald Matt Taibbi many many more all on the right It used to drive me crazy But it doesnt anymore This is what I believe now They all are on the right and so is just about everyone I know whether they know it yet or not And Im on the right And I dont care,5
15,Arguably the right is doing the same thing in the other direction  They feed off each other  I feel like neither party wants to actually do any of the things that they hold as their highest priority  If they solve a problem it means they have nothing to campaign against  Its what keeps them in a position of power,3
16,Very accurate I happen to admire Musk for a variety of reasons starting with his honesty,2
17,This happened to my wife Shes been a life long liberaldemocrat  I have to say the last 10 years or so shes so detached from this woke nonsense that she and I agree more politically than ever,3
18,Im sorry but if anyone believes that the conservatives have not moved right as much as lefties if not more are delusional or just lying,3
19,This is exactly me as well,2
20,I stayed right in the center while almost everyone around me got more polarized Discussions are harder but I just dont talk to many people unless I know we can actually discuss our differences and learn from each other,2
0,Costa is trolling the whole sub wait till they see stricklands account,744

11,Article Summary Reduced by 54Twitter has accepted Elon Musks offer to purchase the company for 44 billion the company announced in a press release today Musk purchased the company at 5420 a share the same price named in his initial offer on April 14th Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated said Musk in a statement included with the release Shortly after Musk announced the buyout plan Twitters board instituted a Poison pill measure suggesting it intended to resist Musks buyout Its unclear what impact Musk will have on Twitter or where hell start with changes Musk has been outspoken in his criticism of Twitter moderation describing himself as a Free speech absolutist and raising concerns over how the platform would moderate under his control Musk originally offered to buy Twitter for 5420 per share on April 14th The offer followed Musks disclosure of acquiring a 92 percent stake a move that made him Twitters largest individual shareholder at the time At one time Musk was offered a seat on the companys board of directors but the deal soon fell apart as a seat on the board would prevent him from buying more than a 149 percent stake in TwitterWant to know how I work Find my source code herehttpsgithubcomcoolirismeautosummarizer Pull Requests are welcome,68

14,I dont get the poison pill thing What does it mean,41
15,BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YES  I dont even have a Twitter account but this shitstorm is gonna be kickass and I cant wait to see it,41
16,Hope he actually makes it decentralized like the fediverse Most likely thing hell do is just bring back Trump and it ends at thatAs long as he doesnt stop anime girls appearing on my timeline everythings business as usual,27
17,For everyone just thinking hes bought it to be the biggest kid in the playground youre right but hes also going to attempt to make it profitable That could mean more ads but I think its likely we see some sort of premium memberships being pushed or extra branding,25
18,While well keep this post up and try not to totally purge the comment section or anything please remember that this subs purpose is to try to get away from reddit talking about  American domestic politics all the timeTwitter is a major social media platform used across the globe Try to think about how these changes could affect the rest of the world,13
19,can he afford it as far as I know his wealth largely sits on overvalued tesla stocks and when he starts selling a lot of those now he might end up bursting his own bubbleI think this is all much more about calling Musks bluff than handing twitter over to him,8
20,I left twitter some months back So I dont give a fuck what happens to it But it would be hilarious to see the meltdown people will have Earlier it used to be twitter is a private company it can do whatever it want Now it will be Elon buying twitter is threat to democracy,8

2,I mean the NFT market will be launching sometime in the next 97 days so we got that goin for us,386
3,MmmYesThis makes meBullish,286
4,Ive been having this exact same feeling lately think about it All of a sudden all these millionaires and billionaires RC Elon Cuban Pulte are coming out talking against WallSt SEC and the Fed the same guys who previously have had issues and runins with short sellers overpriced consultants and other bad actors they all seem connected and for them to become this vocal they must have a well thought out plan U dont go guns blazing without a plan,143
5,Either way as I like to tell my friends weve invested in possibly the singlegreatest company turnaround in history Im proud to be a part of it,129
6,On a scale of 110 how stupid is the idea that Elon having taken Twitter private turns around and proceeds to take his company over to Gmerica where the company is relisted as a blockchainbacked security,112
7,Lol So how is musk buying Twitter any different than bezos buying the postI dont believe for a second any of these billionaires really want to help common man They just want money and power,32
8,a few months ago i made a post on superstonk that has 500k impressions since that day specifically my Twitter has been 100 shadowbanned  impressions dropped to alltime lows i use my name here as i do on twitter and its crazy to see the tech cross over for censorship around talking about big techgamestop and hedge fundsname specifics free it all,32

1,I missed when the democrats just stuck to exterminating entire villages in third world countries like respectable politicians,165
2,The reality is Obama is pretty much just as extreme just his it better,133
3,Obama is as extreme as they come hes just clever enough to put on a normal front The American Left as well as most of Europe is completely overtaken with the neoMarxist ideology If you havent already check out Dr James Lindsay and his New Discourses YouTube channel He spells it all out,115
4,As smart as he is he was blind to the fact that Obama was the first chapter in all of this taking the national stageObama was party to it all,111
5,Im just worried theres going to be some permanent bill that messes up AmericaSuch as if youre white and own more than 100000 you have to hand over the rest to the government,62
6,Does he know Obama is running his 3rd term right now with puppet Biden,50
7,Boys and girls Elon has been redpilled,50
8,Spoiler Its been hijacked by Obama,39
9,Obamas the one who hijacked them,33
10,Musk gets Red Pilled beautiful,31
11,Obama was shit tho Dont get me wrong Im glad Elon is causing leftists to seethe but Obama was a terrible president The whole Twitter thing is kinda sketchy,29
12,I dont see why some people feel Obama is a moderate leftistHis acting skills are better but he has been at the center of undermining America and the rule of lawSmooth criiminal,29
13,Well unfortunately voting for Obama was opening the door to all the insane ridiculousness we have going on now So as I appreciate people coming back to the light its hard for me to forgive the damage they caused,26
14,We arent extremistsstarts burning down everything while vice president asks for donations to bail them out,22
15,I think thats how a lot of people feel I was only in 10th grade while Obama was being elected but my teacher basically just promoted the shit out of him and strait up brainwashed the class I think,17
16,And Im loving every second of it,15
17,In before the left decries this as an attack against Ilhan Omar etc,12
18,I was a firstterm voter for Obama I thought he might deliver on Hope  ChangeHe did the opposite,12
19,Obama played a big role in the fuckery The smithMundt act I believe it was called where he basically legalized straight up propaganda in US media,8
20,He supported a corrupt racist  And hes calling the New Democrats extreme,6
0,Think of all the amazing things you could do with that amount of money You could change the course of humanity for the better with no effort You could house the homeless you could invest in clean energies you could feed the hungry But na you gotta make Twitter safer for racists Billionaires shouldnt exist,83
1,Free speech is not defending speech you agree with Its defending someones rights whom you do not agree with,21
2,Did he actually buy it,5
3,So Much Copium,2
4,Okay Twitter is one of the biggest cesspools on the internet thats no secret People are already saying anything they want on there,1
5,I cant believe how many ppl are simping for him its actually insane lol,1
6,As in he wants it to be like Facebook where you get bombarded with false information hackers and bullied by people who think they are a part of some superior race because of their skin colour but are the reason there are rascal scooters and buy 3 get 1 free sales on diet coke every other week,-1

3,I dont like the precidedent this sets Any billionaire that wants to do it just got shown that they CAN buy a medium of communication Side note corporations already control them under capitalism its just going from one owner to another Still scary though,99
4,Twitter will implode by the end of the summer,88
5,There goes the kids account who tracks his plane activity mUsK WAnTs FrEe SpeEch,84
6,LMAO I saw a random recommended in economy or some other subreddit that said this is good for the economy How Why If he buys it Im gone its already a shitshow,55
7,If he lets Trump back on thats going to incite shit,53
8,You have been banned for saying Musk Sux to appeal your ban you have to watch a 1hr documentary of how Elon musk is a great guy and is a self made billionaire and answer the quiz at the end perfectly,46
9,Of course the only thing capitalism understands is money Moral economic sociological fall out is inconsequential You can always blame anything negative that results on the left minorities snowflakes Karens academics etc,38
10,Wonder if he realizes how much hes going to get Twitter sued by people and counties for violating their laws and right to live with out being harassed or threatened He does know you cant yell fire in a crowded theater without consequences for any injuries or stress caused by doing so plus the jailfines for it,33
11,Soantitrust laws are still a thingright Oh wait nvm Looking at ATT Google and FB amongst all the other large empires,27

14,Well shitThank god for our corrupt and incompetent governmentsIf not for them we might actually tax people in a way that would never result in a situation where a manchild can afford to spend 43b to stroke his ego,9
15,billionaires arent actually worth that much its all in assets that means we cant tax them i am a very smart bootlicker ,10
16,My heart goes out to all of the employees who are now going to be stuck going through a massive workplace culture shift because of the bruised ego of a billionaire oligarch,8
17,Wow this takes me back to when i used to support elon musk mostly for his rockets because Im a space nerdIts so bittersweet now  seeing him for what he really is an oligarch with no regard for the future of humanity,5
18,Does this mean he will unblock the orange menace,5
19,It will be the car tube of social media,3

1,Elon I dont even know who you are,560
2,What percentage of Whites owned Black slaves   Hmmm,269
3,The Union Army should have confiscated all the wealth of white landowners and redistributed every acre to Black folksSounds sort of like what Robert Mugabe did in Zimbabwe Probably because its exactly the same thing,203
4,Dudes completely unhinged,173
5,These checkmarks completely losing their minds over Elons takeover is the best part of this whole thingIdk why but these people getting mad and writing these long threads moping and crying is just so funny,123
6,The when we start roasting your ass line is especially funny As if hes going to see people shitting on him and like immediately go back on everything hes stood for for decades He knows what hes getting into here And he wants it So roast away He WANTS you to,106
7,Seems like hell come off as the better man by just allowing this to be platformed Ad hominem isnt a great look,107
8,Punishing the south for the civil war wouldve just resulted in another civil war,67
9,Grown ass man using the term stans,70
10,It sounds like this dude wanted a second Civil War immediately after the first one,67
11,Time Wise is a well known Jewish antiwhite racist,58
12,Do what I did way back when I got banned for something fucking silly Stop using twitterHell with Musk at the helm I might actually consider starting a new twitter account Musk seems to actually give a fuck about freedom of speechAlso this stupid motherfucker talking about the American Civil war like it was purely a race issue The issue of race was tangential It was an issue of property rights to a lot of the people who fought on the Confederate side Yeah that included slavery but it also included the land anyone owned taxes the right of the state to impose statutes and dictates on matters of local governance all kinds of shit Yeah slavery was a horrible thing to maintain as an institution and the american southerners were absolutely wrong to do so but slavery was not a race issue It was a religion issue Christians could not take slaves who were christian just as large swathes of the Muslim world at the time had rules where Muslims could not take other Muslims as slaves In fact at the same time that slaves were being picked up and taken to the Americas they were also being taken to the middle east where they were usually sterilized and worked literally to death,52
13,based on the notion that they have the right to impose their will on othersNow let me tell you about how I think the Southern population should have been completely eradicated from the face of the Earth and ground in to dust even though most of the people were poor rural farmers who didnt own slaves   Tim Wise whoever the fuck I am,48
14,Who the fuck is Tim Wise,47
15,He sounds like a racist,46
16,This guy seriously thinks his opinion is valued enough to make a freespeech advocate question his devotion to the cause,32
17,So weird If liberals were smart they would make him their poster boy Electric cars Recycling space rockets Nope fuck him Lets instead praise Ibram X Kendi Im left of center but my God these people are stupid None of them have done anything to advance human civilization and they pile on like ants on anyone who tries,35
18,Tim is panicking,29
19,Translation imma virtue signal because Im verified here and dont want to leave lolol,26
20,These people are grown children Its so sad to see Theyre fully grown adults throwing a temper tantrum because their special privileges are being taken awayThis rant is so embarrassingly childish,24
0,I see vanguard mentioned here a lot But if people looked at what they do and where they come from they would realise Vanguard is part of the solution They offer cheap safe effective investment solutions for normal people Vanguard is effectively a cooperative its owned by its customers and employeesThe total lack of basic knowledge is why I think capitalism has wonhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiTheVanguardGroup,102
1,Vanguard is not the problem  Vanguard is part of the solution,86
2,I actually come from the small towns surrounding FB headquarters and Zuckerberg did technically contribute to the insane rise in housing in that area considering he put the HQ in a historically affordable area with a community of people of color I used to live down the street from FB HQ and now I dont because of the exorbitant renthousing prices of the area for 50 year old houses with minimal renovationsupdates but getting market rate I agree hes not responsible for the cost of housing skyrocketing across metro areas in the US but he is partly responsible for displacing POC in the neighborhood I grew up in,71
3,If you want to keep following the trail you end up at the kochs they are who lobbied to change the laws to be softer on monopolies and government support for the Uber wealthy around the Regan administration and if you keep going yo get to the rockafellers the story only stops when you stop following it the musknestlemonsantoPinkerton stuff is just whats in the zeitgeist atm,74
4,You just listed four peoples whos combined wealth is a significant proportion of Americas wealth I dont know how the hell you think theyre not a huge part of why conditions are so bad when theyre part of the small group funding all of the political corruption in the USA   They all lobby against progress they all own media channels to push propaganda against it Yeah theyre not the only ones but how does that make them any more above criticism  Also a lot of the reason that Musk is criticized how he is is because hes falsely being touted as a rags to riches story He forms an important part of the right wing narrative that capitalism works because some people can make it rich Every temporary embarrassed millionare is looking to the four that you listed which makes it even more important to dispel the mystique theyve purchased for themselves,59
5,Seriously what conspiracy theory are you people reading that makes you think Vanguard is part of the problem And why are these brain dead posts popping up in this sub more and more frequently,40
6,You already posted this yesterday and you never explained how Vanguard is bad,30
7,FWIW when you say blah blah blah are the real problem it highlights how critically weak your comprehension is of the complexity of society and its various systems of power that affect the working class Then I read the rest of your post My logic is sound Scolding Reddit users for misdirecting their attention rambling about your own interpretation of societal oppressions as the real problem telling a subreddit of 1 million users that THEIR efforts are missing the mark Its clear you wanted to write something intelligent read it back to yourself 100 times pat yourself on the back rake in the Karma clout for your stellar contribution and fall asleep in ego sheets after a long day signaling virtueYour entrepreneur is showing,27
8,You are complaining a lot but saying absolutely nothing Sorry we dont meme the billionaires you dont likeSorry we do meme the billionaires you do like Im not sure what you want here,23
9,The real problem is capitalism Focusing on individual billionaires and corporations wont actually solve the issues You cant afford rent because the entire economy is built around generating profit above all else Raising taxes and welfare are good for harm reduction but real improvements can only be permanently achieved by dismantling capitalism,18
10,This sub is definitely NOT missing the mark Posts like this one right here appear AT LEAST twice daily,17
11,How is Vangaurd part of the problem Jack Bogle has probably done more for the average person than anyone the past 100 years,11
12,If you dont want to sound sympathetic towards billionaires dont write a thinly veiled post expressing sympathy for billionaires,12
13,Divisive post Everyone ignore,10
14,Its weird how many folks we have rolling up in here lately to ask us to leave Elon Musk alone,10
15,Why cant they all be part of the problem Because frivolous decisions made by these few ridiculously wealthy individuals affects us all Just look at the stock market anytime one of them makes a decision and realize that your 401k is the stock market,7
16,I say we keep it simple and just burn the entire system to the ground Ive got a full gas tank and an alibi whos in,10
17,Ive worked directly for Steven Schwarzman Blackstone In his office in fact He is indeed part of the problem and should be memes whenever possible Not saying others shouldshouldnt be and arearent but he definitely should be memed,5
18,Theres always a bigger asshole,5
19,Lol Elon Musk is a union buster and an enemy of actual sustainable transport aka public transit Hyper tunnels are definitely better than high speed rails becauseJeff Bezos is also a union buster like these are the easiest ways to highlight how bosses and CEOs do not care about you Start by pointing out how Jeff Bezos does not care make parallels to your own CEOs who do not care Unionize,3

1,It feels like they just turned off the follower manipulation algorithm  Most right wing people gained thousands of followers this week too  All the shit that we know they were doing is going to be hidden before Musk gets to see anything,238
2,So either twitter knew about the bots and could of got rid of them already or he designed it without even have accessing,112
3,hundreds of conservative blue check marks are reporting that their followers have gone up in the thousands  TENS of thousandsall overnightMeanwhile liberal meatheads Mark Hammil are showing big losses as their bots are being purgedSomeone at Twitter is cleaning house before Elon shows up and asks to see the books,82
4,Mark Hamill lost like 8000 followers the day Elon took back the digital square Probably his most active robos,49
5,I think people are leaving and others are getting back on or starting an account The amount of bots is probably bigger than the numbers were seeing,14
6,Conspiracy theory what if Elon is purging Twitter of all these bots and fake humans But pulls out of the deal because Twitter manipulated its user number due to so many bots which would be a breach of the deal,11
7,Elon musk your Followers are literal NPCs Truth in advertising is what this is,7
8,robots have free speech rights too,6
9,Chad Prather said he picked up like 1500 new followers on the day after the purchase announcement  Id heard some other luminary cant recall the name right thus moment got 4500  Both had been shadow banned forever,4
10,so my account is unbanned now,4
11,Keep mah followers out ya fuckin mouf,4
12,After reading these comments Elon taking over Twitter is a breath of fresh air and the right move Goodness won this week,5
13,If its confirmed that Twitter was internally running botnets to artificially portray a much larger and more active user base than originally existed there are some BIG implications thereEven if nobody buys Facebook if theres suspicion that something similar is going on there shareholders could potentially sue the company for fraud just like it appears Twitter may have been committing  Or the SEC could get involved as wellIt doesnt matter what product or service you are selling its illegal to falsify sales  Twitter and Facebook may be free to use but their value is based in part of purported numbers of users that then drive what is charged to advertisers who are the companys actual paying customers  If its proven that Twitter and Facebook have been fraudulently inflating their number of users thats a BIG DEAL  Bots dont buy products  So if Facebook is telling a potential advertiser that they will have X number of eyes on their ads its fraudulent when those eyes are actually bots,4
14,No need to reuse or recycle here just reduce by chucking that garbage straight into a dumpster fire,2
15,httpssocialbladecomCheck for yourself youll see many leftoids dropping thousands upon thousands of followers,2

2,Ut oh Main page Reddit isnt gonna like that,298
3,a bunch of people are about to be fired after the deal closes,125
4,Liberalism is not and have never been a leftist ideology,87
5,Lol how can anyone say with a straight face that the right hasnt changed since 2008,80
6,You honestly have to have brain damage or an IQ of 55 to think the right has stayed in the same spot the past decade and a half,70
7,Did Elon buy twitter just to post that,62
8,So trick question Does the fact that he is objectively still on the left despite the far left moving so far make him a leftyor does the fact that he hasnt moved at all in 10 years make him a conservativeOf course the real question we all really want to know is where is he on the Y axis,52
9,False dichotomy The culture war is used as a dividing tool for the lower classes There is no leftfreedom wing Its a totalitarian technological feudal oligarchy and Elon knows because he is part of it,40
10,Hail the new meme Lord Elon Musk after the old Lord Trumps forced retirement,39
11,Mitt Romney was a presidential nominee in 2012 and now considered a traitor within the GOP who was on the verge of getting killed during January 6thI am not sure how any intelligent person could believe this graphic,39
12,Lmao the apartheid daddy billionaire pretending he was ever left leaning is hilarious The Right has always been open and honest about fucking over people in favor of corporate greed The speaker of the house claims to be allegedly a centrist and this bitch is all about enabling corporate greed just quietly The radical left who want shit like universal healthcare so that people dont fucking die from poverty if they get sick arent radical at all Theyre just finally speaking up Theyre not on the fuck the people bird the Democrats and Republicans are on and they hate it,34
13,if you think the right hasnt moved in 13 years you are beyond hope at understanding politics,31
14,The rights definitely become more authoritarian and conservative Nixon had a health care plan for all now thats considered socialism Policies like social welfare education minimum wage workers unions are all shunned by the right now Mainstream America is definitely more right wing now compared to the 70s,32
15,Crazy how a dumb post appeals so much to one side of the US political spectrum,27
16,MFW I am brainless enough to think a hairplug libertarian was ever center left,18
17,WEF stooge or not  Musk has been absolutely unloading truthbombs on Twitter the last couple of days Everything from relentless visuals which until recently were verboten to an interesting exchange with Dave RubinRubin points out legacy media like NYTimes has as many as 50 million followers yet rarely gets 50 retweets on posts whereas other accounts like his regularly achieve thousands of engagement  musk replies tersely i noticed that toohe has gone so far as to drop subtle jokes making fun of sensationalized freedom of speech by referencing the cocaine in cocacola to subtle hints of what may be to come twitter DMs should really have endtoend encryptionmusk stands to acquire every record of every DM extantall that aside this is a fabulous illustration of a point  the progressive left has moved the goal posts time and time again while moderates have more or less stayed the same the Overton Window has shifted and most people are left wondering how they have suddenly found themselves being called rightwingers glenn greenwald instantly comes to mind,16
18,This was on Infowars too lmao,16

1,Elon Musk said in a tweet on Thursday night that the modern Democratic Party has been hijacked by extremists    I strongly supported Obama for President but todays Democratic Party has been hijacked by extremists Musk wroteI feel very similarly I personally voted for Obama after previously voting for George W Bush i felt the Republicans back then were leading us into Conflict and War after War But now its the Democrats who have oddly taken that position but instead of a foreign enemy Dems have declared war on the American People,397
2,Hes a bit late to the party but welcome nonetheless,381
3,The same extremists were present during the Obama administration,119
4,Hes not wrong Look at my uncle Lifelong Democrat Always pretty consistent in his beliefs Now hes a hardcore trump supporter Why Because the Democrats went fucking insane and left him behind They have gone all in on extremism in an attempt to push the window as far to the left as possible and its backfiring They are losing centrists by the thousands,79
5,The GOP is lazy  Period,66
6,I think wokeness culture is changing at 10x speed than any other culture at this point,60
7,I like the part where all these Liberals come out and prove Elon is 100 correct with their responses to a cartooncomic  Brilliant  Fun reading The official platform of the Democratic Party in 1996 presidencyucsbedudocuments1996democraticpartyplatform  Take a peak and skim some pageslol,50
8,Both parties are dead,45
9,This has been known to some people for a long timePretty sure it extends to the Republicons too,20
10,Just look at this sub Have we ever had more classic liberals post on here than we do now Even on subs that are usually left leaning youre seeing huge pushback Americans are clearly tired of the woke bullshit,13
11,Dont be fooled Obamas ideology was just as bad,6
12,If you cannot see that both parties are leading us in the wrong direction then you have been decieved One party does it more extreme than the other,9
13,The Ministry of Truth asks that you stop by for a visit  Bring a toothbrush,5
14,Completely correct,1
15,Not hijacked they went willingly,4
16,I cant say hijacked as I think its the same people its always been They just love to push boundaries and with every boundary crossed they have another one to push,1
17,They took in the extremists knowingly the latest victims are just nutters The DNC wasnt hijacked they did this,1
18,Seriously Its pretty telling when there are only 2 moderate Democratic senators Regardless I dont want them to be silenced because you dont defeat bad ideas with censorship you defeat bad ideas with good ones,3
19,Even a staunch liberal like Maher has been saying this for years but its nice to see Elon actually do something about it,4
20,I honestly wish someone would reform reddit the way twitter will be Reddit is far more biased than twitter These jannies are tyrants,3

5,Comedian Kathy Griffin called business magnate Elon Musk a white supremacist in a tweet on Monday    While attacking Musk Griffin also took a swipe at media figure Piers Morgan who fired back referencing Griffins controversial decision years ago to pose with an object that looked like the bloodied head of thenPresident Donald TrumpMouthpiece Kathy Griffin attempts to paint Elon Musk as a White Supremacist for finally bringing the 1st Amendment to Twitter Just one more person in a long line of Libs who fail to see how Republicans have been treated the past few years in regards to Social Media Platforms,199
6,A white American is calling a South African a white supremacist Incredible,139
7,That term means nothing now Especially coming from Howdy Doodys mouth,107
8,10 years ago he was their golden god because he was making electric vehicles and helping the environment Now he supports free speech and they all hate him and call him a white supremacist Looks like liberals openly care more about controlling speech than they do about helping the environment,78
9,I dont think elonmusk should take vindictive lectures from someone who gleefully posed with a mockedup model of a US Presidents severed head then played the pitiful victim card to get herself out of any accountability for such a vile stunt Morgan respondedPiers Morgan is earning back my respect lately,67
10,Kathy called an African American a white supremacist lol,51

0,I dont really care about Musk himself My issue is the sheer hypocrisy People are suddenly saying theor speech will be restricted and he will use his power to selectively ban accounts like Big Tech especially Twitter havent been doing that for yearsMSNBC said that he would use it to promote good info on presidential candidates he likes and hide good info on candidates he doesnt That he would exaggerate the bad and put it to the front for candidates he hates while doing the opposite for those he likes like Big Tech and mainstream media hasnt been doing that for yearsPeople are screaming that billionaires are able to purchase entire media platforms like Billionaires havent been doing that for yearsAll of that stuff they were mocking political opponents for suddenly might be used on them and now its an issue Its their platform They can do what they want Dont like it lol Use a different platformSo yeah Dont care about Musk one way or the other because its the same thing thats been happening for years But absolutely floored at the people complaining about it like this is a new and sudden issue like it hasnt been talked about for decades But since this is a comment about peoples hypocrisy I fully expect to get downvotedEdit You could secretly ban one partys candidatesecretly turn down the reach of their stuff and turn up the reach of something else and the rest of us might not even find out about it until AFTER the electionhttpstwittercomMaryMargOlohanstatus1518787650815201281t78oJgsEPenXEdZ7iETiQgQs19From MSNBC Like this is some new threat instead of whats been happening for decades Centuries,3606
1,I certainly wouldnt call myself a defender of Musk since Im really sure what there is to defend but SpaceX just safely returned 4 astronauts from the ISS and the next day launched 4 more to the station which as far as I know is a first Him buying Twitter is a nonstory for me Twitter has about 200 million daily users which isnt much compared to facebooks almost 2 billion daily usersNot having to rely on the Russians for rides to space is a bigger deal for me That plus the fact hes managed to some what disrupt the auto industry to a point where most manufactures are making EVs which is nice for the environment Basically Id like to have a livable planet in my senior years or at least some way to get off this rock if it all goes to hell Which was my opinion pre TeslaSpaceXDefend him NahDo I appreciate the effortwork he does Yes,2303
2,He can be a real idiot and he and I have some massive ideological differences  But people can be friends even with large differences  Not that he and I are friends but you get what I meanWhere a persons personal beliefs become a problem is when they start affecting others  I thought Trump was a loveable scoundrel until he ran for office and became president when all those scoundrel attributes became dangerous and infectiousBut the question was Why defend  Musk and the answer is twofold1 He has been behind some of the most disruptive changes the world has seen  Safe online payments reliable high performance electric vehicles cheaper reusable space launch and reentry vehicles and thats just the most well known  I find it annoying when people forget these things each time he announces something new  Maybe it will work maybe it wont but doesnt his track record at least earn him the right to give it a shot without being ridiculed  Disrupting the way the world works is never easy and even if he only gets it right every 20 tries hes still way WAY ahead of the curve  Bonus annoyance points is where the detractors start by saying he cant do something and is wasting his time and money on it and then when he starts doing it change the argument to he cant do it as well as it needs to be and then cant do it in a way that satisfies everyone and then highlighting the fringe cases when it satisfies most people except the fringe  I defend him then because the people Im defending him against are generally idiots with bad or flaky arguments  And Im excited to see what he can pull off next2 He can be a real jerk  He does things I dont agree with and is famous enough that a lot of his personal life is public  And the people attacking him seem to forget that he has a right to be himself  If he were running for public office then we should worry about what he believes but until then let him be him  Hes on the autism spectrum and so am I so I guess Im a little sensitive to the fact that his brain works differently and he sees things differently and he gets attacked for it  I defend him against people who attack him for being different because in many ways I feel like Im defending my right to be different and see the world in a way that others do notTwo examples1 The UN World Food Program Chief said that 2 of Musks wealth then 6 billion could end world hunger  Musk said If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how 6B will solve world hunger I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it  The WFP chief then sent a breakdown of how Musks 6 Billion could avert famine and claimed that Musk should pay up  Clearly a plan to avert famine is not the same as solving world hunger  And yet Musk was attacked for not giving 6 billion to the UN for a plan that was not what he agreed to and at best a plaster placed on a gushing arterial wound    Why was Musk criticised for this and not the WFP chief who lied and misled everyone  For the record anyone serious about solving world hunger knows that the only way to do this is by building rugged and reliable transport infrastructure and not getting food to people  In almost all instances of institutionalised or entrenched ongoing hunger issues food is not the problem there is usually food available  Its access to food that is the problem  Solutions that use noninfrastructure solutions to transport food will never provide any lasting benefit and usually end up putting more money into the hands of unscrupulous people transporting the food than providing food to the hungry    2 A lot has been said about Musks treatment of his employees  If you go solely by the negative press he seems to be as monster  But if you look closer you find that not only are his employees paid more per hour than his competitors they also get health insurance stock and other benefits  Many of his employees acknowledge that he is a hard worker who sometimes sleeps at the office and that he expects the same from his staff  Whether or not this is reasonable or OK is a question that is open to discussion  But the majority of his staff seem to be OK with it    Why does he get all this negative press about it especially since Amazon and Walmart literally pay their employees so little these working staff need to be on welfare and they are simultaneously worked so hard they experience health issues  Im not defending his treatment of staff as such but if the majority of them seem OK with it while the majority of Amazon and Walmart staff are not OK with their treatment why keep going after MuskI guess what it boils down to is that in my view Musk does far more good than bad  and I say this acknowledging that he does both  but seems to get far more criticism than he deserves and a significant amount more criticism than others who certainly appear to do more bad than good  I guess its an inequality thing that gets to me,1005
3,I dont think people are really defending Musk about the twitter thing moreso pointing out the hypocrisy When Trump was suspended everyone said its a private platform and they can do what they want Now these same people are suddenly concerned about big tech,692
4,I dont defend him But when people make assumptions and straight up lie I will call them out for it A lot of people hate him just because its trendy to do so In reality they dont know anything about him,668
5,I dont get the blind hate or blind love of him I am amazed by what he has achieved in a number of areas hes clearly a brilliant clear thinker in terms of engineering but hes still flawed He says and does things I dont like but so far the world is a much better place because of him,374
6,A lot of it is not about Musk but the blatant hypocrisy of the attacks Eg yesterday the likes of WaPo responding to his criticism of twitters decisions around the hunter laptop story accused him of inciting attacks on the executive who made the decision Would these outlets ever restrict themselves from criticising a corporations public decisions on the grounds of not distressing their senior executives No of course not that is a ridiculous standard Yet they happily apply that bizarre principle to Musk and do so with a nauseating dose of sanctimony despite the obvious double standard of their position That is annoying,246
7,Those who attack him why do you feel the need to attack him,189
8,My problem with this issue is when you ask people why they dont like Elon theyre like yeah he overspent on a poorly executed attempt to reduce traffic and he actually didnt invent the electric car hes basically a fascist,172
9,I dont really defend him I just think self driving electric cars and rockets are pretty cool,142
10,There are plenty of good arguments against Elon Musk There are a lot more bad ones I dont like seeing people argue in bad faith or just spouting a narrative without bothering to look into it I especially dont like it when those bad arguments become cultural zeitgeists that promote unrest or even hateLets take the twitter buyending homeless analogy How many times have you seen it said that Elon or another billionaire could end homelessness for 40b Heres the federal financial data on US homeless spendinghttpsdatalabusaspendinggovhomelessnessanalysis JUST the city of New York spent 32 billion in 2019 Sadly the study doesnt cite a total but based on what is there it seems a reasonable estimate that nationwide we spent about 10 billion on homelessness in the entire united states 14 of whats supposedly necessary So has homelessness gone down a similar amount Nope In fact its gone upIt took me longer to write this comment then to find this information And thats what it comes down to for me Misinformation is a fucking plague on our society I do occasionally feel a need to speak out against it Rip on Elon Musk all you want Heres a video doing just that I personally find hilarioushttpsyoutubemoeSKBmYbEg But know what the fuck youre talking about first,130
11,He is 100 a wacky fuck but the misinformation campaign against him is insanely unfair and goes way too far It scares me,121
12,Its so funny how reddit went fromYAY ELON Epic rocket space Inhabit mars and escape this shitty earth ftw Teslas are awesome and greenTo absolutely hatred in the span of like 4 years This site is pathetic,116
13,I dont get why people feel the need to attack him Of all the billionaires that have a high profile it seems hes the least obnoxious Bezos is putting small businesses out of business Gates is buying up farmland Bloomburg acts like Napolean why does Musk rate the hate I dont hang with billionaires or know that much about them so its a real question,117
14,Lets flip thatWhy does so many people feel the need to use your own words to attack Elon MuskThe hate and vitriol in reddit comments about Elon Musk has reached absolutely ridiculous levels Most people have no clue about the history of Elon Musk OR Tesla OR SpaceX etcThey only parrot what they heard someone else say and jump on the hate bandwagon,103
15,You ask the question in a way that implies he did something Terrible  What did he do Is buying Twitter terrible Boohoo,88
16,Because he didnt do anything wrong He legally purchased a company and can do what he wants with it and frankly I support a platform with completely free speech,71
17,Because I really enjoy the shoe being on the other foot  If I had a political party its the Shoe Is On the Other Foot party  Oh Twitter is a private company they can do what they want  If you dont like it go make your own  Suddenly the people who were saying that smugly are all wailing and gnashing their teeth,38
18,Why attack him ,34
19,I defend the good stuff he does  Hes not a monster but hes certainly not perfect either,31
20,Too many people hate on him seemingly only because theyre envious of his wealth Im pretty indifferent about most billionaires but I think hes pushing the advancement of many technologies and Im a fan of thatIs he perfect Like everyone no But hes one of the most famous people alive so everything he does is analyzed and judged as if anyone else couldve done what hes done,30
0,I mean its all peoples made up bullshit he has always been a rather aggressive ego driven ruthless business person who has acquired the vast majority of his businesses through hostile take overs and then enjoy the spot light of it allPeople wanted to see him as some sort of eco savior but nothing he has actually done shows that to be the truthSo his journey was people opening their eyes a little,788
1,I think Musk would make a very compelling super villain if he werent so cringy all the time It makes it hard to really enjoy his villainy when youre constantly rolling your eyes at him,288
2,Strong Libertarian  Ancap streak in tech especially finance Greentech energy independence commercial space explorationpersonal mobility and now virtual currency attract the libertarians as well  imho the general mistake is to equate what a sales pitch tells you a business is doing which is a pitch to customers and maybe the extended community of shareholders with what is business is actually doing which is producing a return on capital for the investors and managers that run the business,127
3, thorough explanationNo not really Even the personal anecdote about ownership experience degrading isnt even given cursory detail Its an interesting overview of the changing public persona but it pretty much only covers the highlights and contains little depth or new information beyond what is readily apparent Reporting on cable news coverage and riling up fanatic morons on twitter doesnt really strike me as getting to the heart of the issues of his wealth power and influence,80
4,Its quite simple actually The left fights and argues with each other for good or for ill whereas the right are fiercely loyal and will rather completely change their opinion on something over disagreeing with what their leadership says or doesMusk is no different than Trump or all the outrage grifters like Rubin or Loomer who used to shout about liberal ideals and then made a hard right turn literally Its all about ego You can even see it in their grievances that are usually something like these people can never be satisfied Musk thought that he would be endlessly praised for being the poster boy for green energy but instead still faced criticism for his boneheaded ideas and unethical decisions Way easier to be an altright fanboy whining about wokism where no matter what dumb shit you say what awful choices you make or what morally bankrupt actions you perform conservatives will fawn and defend you every step of the way,71
5,Can someone ELI5 the Sneeches by Seuss,31
6,Nothing funnier than a bunch of mediocre white dudes on Reddit fawning over a guy that got rich mostly cause his daddys emerald mine in apartheid South Africa allowed him to buy the hard work of others,25
7,Im starting to think we should just rename this sub to rmindreadingfallacy,16
8,Never been a fan of Musk but given his behavior lately I strongly feel that buying Twitter is one step of many to come for building a medial channel for political reasons and it worries me,13
9,Alex Jones was in A Scanner Darkly as he was at the timeA lefty liberal screaming about corruption on a street corner Both musk and jones learned valuable lessons If you want to make money scream about how liberals are not allowing you to make enough money Then talk shit about everyone to keep headlines up,12
10,For the capitalist class the difference between liberal and conservative political parties is akin to your shopping preference between Target or WalMart Theyll go to whichever one is more convenient or has a particular stock at the current moment,6
11,The lesson is that everyone forget that people are complicated and their achievements dont equal their personality You see it in sports a lot where you want some superstar athlete to be model citizen then some video comes out showing Michael Phelps ripping a bong oh the humanity What will the children think Musk is a rare example of someone that just puts his real personality on show instead of a fake publicist approved persona Hes cringy as fuck and extremely weird and unlikeable but at the same time at least its real    That doesnt mean that SpaceX isnt fucking amazing or that Teslas arent cool as fuck It also doesnt mean that your favorite athletemusician doesnt watch child porn and that the CEO of the company whos shoes you are wearing doesnt support child labor    People are complicated and it shouldnt be a surprise that the top 1 in a field are egomaniacs,6
12,Thoroughly explainsLol He bought a tesla car and is bored of it and makes a parallel to ElonI dont think this is the hit piece people were hoping for,6
13,Grifter gonna grift they dont care what your beliefs are,6
14,Its kind of depressing how easy it is to pander to the conservativesTo get the liberals on his side he had to more or less create a new transportation sector bring electric cars into the mainstream and reform the private space industryTo get the conservative vote all he had to do is spend a bunch of money say free speech a few times and smoke weed with a podcasterMaybe I should run on the GOP side Just take loudly about how everything is too woke while I quietly vote for universal healthcare They dont seem to care how people vote anyways,6
15,musk is a parasite feeding on humanitykinda like any billionaire,2
16,What confuses me is why the poster and a lot of others think EM or anyone else should be categorised based upon a ridiculous binary viewpointIt is perfectly possible to share views with people on different sides of the political spectrum at the same time,3
17,So tldr guy looks out for himselfWhy is anyone surprised Thats all 99 of people do,1
18,This is why its important to have a consistent political viewpoint and not resort to neoliberal aesthetics To neoliberals Elon will be appealing in some form whether he is owning the libs or being environmentally friendly But in reality hes a piece of shit who illtreats his employees and business partners and he has always been If people viewed him that way 10 years ago theyd still be right today If they look at him purely for aesthetics then they might think hes changed He hasnt,1
19,There was zero insightsubstance in this post just a mild rant How can this be considered thorough,1
20,I still think his push for Hyperloop has little to do with the technology and more to do with trying to kill transportation solutions he is not invested in,1

1,Answer The New York Times leaked a Twitter conversation between Elon Musk and Bill Gates In the conversation EM asks BG if he still has a 500M short position on TeslaDo you still have a half billion short position on Tesla EMShorting a stock drives down share price so we can assume that EM isnt happy about BGs massive short positionBG confirms the short position then requests a discussion about EM donating to his philanthropy projectSorry to say I havent closed it out I would like to discuss philanthropy possibilities BGEM rejects BGs requestSorry but I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla the company doing the most to solve climate change EM Its unclear why the NY Times leaked the conversation Its unclear who leaked the conversation to the NY Times EM says he is not the source of the leak but he confirms that he shared the tweets with friends,1441

3,Answer   Elon Musk on Friday said texts that show he turned down a philanthropic opportunityhttpstwittercomWholeMarsBlogstatus1517626832241057792refsrctwsrc5Etfw7Ctwcamp5Etweetembed7Ctwterm5E15176268322410577927Ctwgr5E7Ctwcon5Es1refurlhttps3A2F2Fwwwbusinessinsidercom2Felonmuskturneddownbillgatesphilanthropyoverteslashort20224 with Bill Gates over the latters short position on Tesla are legitimate  Orgins of the texts are unclear but based on the color the text boxes it would appear it originated from Elon Muskss phone he claims it wasnt him and must have been friends of some friendsIts not clear when the text messages were sent  Though shortly after confirming the texts were real Musk also tweeted a meme of Gates that compared the Microsoft founder to the pregnant man emoji and wrote in case u need to lose a boner fastBill Gates has not commented on the recent exchange  He has said in the past that Elon Musk and Tesla are one of the biggest contributers to stop climate change  But passenger cars were easy and the hard stuff steel cement meat isnt the things people think about  the electricity passenger cars  are a third of the problem So we have to work on the twothirdsThe last two thirds need to be worked on right now because it will have a longer lead time to implement and a great impact  Last year when Gates was asked if he was shorting Tesla he stated he doesnt talk about his investments and Musk should be very proud of what he has accomplished,188
4,Answer bill wants Elon to join the dark side disguised as philanthropy,-1
5,,-53
6,Answer Ehhh idk I feel like they havent gotten along in a while Elon Musk tends to not like and not work with anyone that takes a Tesla short It is a shame though since I would imagine that a lot could get done to tackle climate change if they worked together,-53

1,If he could just lay down and die Id think a lot more of him Just saying,195
2,The mods gave him an appropriate flair lol literal nazi profiteer,187
3,This has got to be the worst flex Ive seen on here,179
4,My grandfather was a fucking monster and I blithely accept my inheritance of his blood money but being born into such wealth has no bearing on my future success or quality of character I am very smart,129
5,People really dont understand how helpful generation wealth is For example my dad inherited the house I grew up in Thats a huge money saver Now imagine that times 1000 and you get Elon Inheritance tax now,98
6,Imagine bootlicking an industrialist robber baron Our grandparents were forced to accept the buyout in their time now we are begging harder daddy,91
7,bringing that up unprompted is quite the unforced error,44
8,He was just smart enough to buy his way into innovative companies that were offering solutions that spoke to the technocratic liberals Then he ran those companies like the parsimonious dictator he is while giving off the faade of a savior to his fan boys and investors,20
9,Elon musk  should give back all that stolen labor plus interest Inheriting it is no excuse,15
10,Interestingly enough Elon followed in his parents footsteps since Lithium mines owned by him to Gatter Lithium for the batteries of Teslas have  even more live threatening working conditions than emerald mines,15

15,You mean steal a car company spaceflight company and so on up to and including the legal right to pretend it was all his own work from the tens of thousands if not more people who collectively did the actual work necessary to produce those things Thats what capitalists do They steal not just all material wealthpower but the credit for your labor and sacrifice under the pretense that robbing the labor of others is honest work,6
16,These people dont even realize that they are telling on themselves,5
17,This capitalist doesnt understand capitalism,6
18,I like that billionaires pay people to make fake accounts to astroturf public opinion of themselves when like half of reddit will just do that for free,4

1,We all know socialists wont spend their money on the poor that is what the rich is for They get paid and suddenly become mini capitalists but expect everyone else to still be communists and socialists,152
2,Someone else on Twitter noted that Musk is supposed to end world hunger for a one time use of 44 billion but the US government cant do it in the US for 4 trillion annually,133
3,Lol  I hadnt thought of it that way but theyre right,51
4,If every active user on Twitter donated 150 that would be 50 billion So whos choosing not to end world hunger,43
5,It always falls on the people they hate to solve all the worlds problemsHow about people of all political parties working together to solve the worlds problems like mature adults instead,36
6,Pretty good take,26

9,Didnt he tweet to Bernie Sanders that he would cash out enough money to end world hunger if they could show on paper how it could be done ,7
10,How do you solve world hunger with a one time payment Give everyone in the world 1 meal and we all eat at the same time So we have a few hours where no ones hungry,3
11,gold  but they only like charitable work with other peoples money which they deserve for existing,2
12,Wish I woulda thought of that in a conversation just yesterday,2
13,They could have just given it to him for free they decided the price not him ,2
14,Ya know thats the funny thing  it seems they always want the people they hate to sacrifice all their money to solve these problems  never once do they look to the billionaires and CEOs that they simp for  such as Bill Gates  and say wait a minute youre a multibillionaire why dont YOU do anything to solve these problemsWhy is it these lunatics think that the shit they wine endlessly about should be everyone elses responsibility but theirs Why is it they want everyone else to sacrifice except the people they like,2

0,The complete 180 degree turn is just fascinating on all this,1332
1,EU just passed new censorship law nytimescomlive20220425businesselonmusktwittermusksgoaloflessmoderationcouldconflictwithneweuropeanregulationssmidurlcopy on Saturday any platforms not policing what the govts say is not true misinformation or find offensive hate will be fined up to 6 of their global revenue or be completely shut down,613
2,Pretty simply solution In situations like this where local laws and regulations are the issue dont punish the user or block and  the tweet everywhere Have a geo tag of some sort that restricts the tweet in that specific area with a message that comes up explaining that this is a government censorship not a company censorship I know the end result for the affected people will be the same However its the little distinctions like that which matter If the government is gonna come in and regulate then correctly put the blame on them,314
3,Wow unelected assholes in Belgium saying that Europe cant be free,223
4,Anyone who wants to benefit from this market will have to fulfill our rules The board of Twitter will have to make sure that if it operates in Europe it will have to fulfill the obligations including moderation open algorithms freedom of speech transparency in rules obligations to comply with our own rules for hate speech revenge porn and harassmentOh is that going to be enforced now I thought it was accepted to have closed algorithms to silence certain trends and articles Looked like it was okay for a while to silence opinions for being wrong think Seemed okay to spout hate speech as long as it was directed towards a certain demographic,204

10,But its a private company if EU doesnt like it they can makebuy their own twitter,49
11,Thats laughable Foreign elites are now trying to tell private companies what to do,44

6,Exactly like Facebook suggested Not promoted where you can check it and subscribe on it not paid content just suggested,80
7,Funny Went on twitter and searched losing followersThe check marks are all asking why its happening Theyve really been thinking all this time that that many people actually care what they have to say lol The first one that comes up is David Hogg with a post in which he wonders maybe Im losing followers because Im an idiot with too many followersDelicious,65
8,There is another way to look at this  They may not be bots They may have been people violating Twitters TOS or the law with the knowledge of twitter staffers   My instinct is that some of it is bots and some of it is people at Twitter realizing they cant keep giving their team a pass and cleaning out violations that they knew about and were allowing to continue,49
9,Not only are the leftists losing followers but some centrist and rightwingers have been gaining a ton of followers I wonder if more people are joining Also Im hearing about peoples accounts that were terminated for BS reasons being reactivated The shift is real,43
10,I stopped caring what people on Twitter said or thought once I realized that 10 of Twitter users are responsible for 92 of Tweets,34
11,Yeah they are panickingThey are removing all the false followers they added on lefty accounts to artificially make them look more popular than they really areAnd they are removing the algorithm filters on righty accounts that made them artificially less popular than what they really are,30
12,They had to clean house and scrub the walls of any evidence This is a digital way of shredding everything that would confirm what we all already know Probably propped up the value of it at the same time,23
13,Ive heard many on the libertarianconservative side saw huge jumps in their follower countTo me this indicates a little housecleaning before the new bossman comes to the office,23
14,Fake followers just like their fake voters,20
15,Elon should buy Reddit when it IPOs as well and take it back private haha,19
16,After 2016 Twitter and the rest of the social media ecosystem was coopted and reoriented not to reflect society but to shape it Itd been that way with journalists since forever shaping the news rather than reporting the news but then there was full blown naked coordination between Democrats journos NGOs leftist PACS and big tech to prevent 2016 from ever happening again,13
17,The bots almost made twitter unusable Im glad they are mostly getting d,14
18,Between the bots and shadow banning Twitter was and is total nonsense Seems like they are trying to cover their tracks before the new team takes over,11
19,So were already at the point where they are proverbially flushing things down the toilets before the police come in,10
20,I thought I read today that the Biden administration was announcing a new Disinformation Governance Board Its pretty clear theyve been colluding behind the scenes with these tech companies and never expected anything like someone to purchase one of them,9

1,I dont think Elon Musk is going to receive a reality check  We are about to see the power of a fully armed superBillionaire battle station who doesnt give two flying fucks about reality personally Ive always felt like he has more than a bit of James Bond villain in himlets hope I was wrong,182
2,The shit storm that would ensue if he decided to block twitter access in the EU would be hilarious,171
3,They have 7000 employees doing what,105
4,Im sure EU isnt perfect But for stuff like this I love it so much Just like the USBC chargers they are pushing for,67
5,And in true Musk fashion he has clarified his stance to be mostly compatible with EUs reality check By free speech I simply mean that which matches the law I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law If people want less free speech they will ask government to pass laws to that effectTherefore going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people,30
6,We are going to have hundreds of somethingsomethingTwitterposts for months now right,28
7,The language in the headlines really tell you a lot about the audiences of each of these publications,20
8,Musk already said within the scope of law in his own posts,20
9,d,19
10,Im appalled by how many people in this thread think the government should control the Internet Or any piece of the Internet,11
11,If the EU wants censorship dont operate in the EU,5
12,d,3
13,Musk Musk Musk Musk Muskhere we go We can shut off tech now Theres nothing but Musk anyway,4
14,Of course They are going to keep removing ilegal content Now Twitter was removing more things than that Politically motivated moderation was the norm,4
15,The only time I use Twitter is when I get free entries into a give away for reposting and tagging I see as much value in that as a used condom full of fire ants Why wouldnt he just make his own system I mean its not like the guy just buys whatever business vs really creating something new and different Ohoh waitI forgot who we were talking about for a second Never mind,4
16,Wonder how Elon would feel if Twitter became a union shop,2
17,People dont realize that Twitter isnt banning people for politics but for compliance and market reasons If Elon wants a Twitter that isnt constantly harrassed by governments and losing advertisers he would run Twitter in pretty much the same manner its currently being run,3
18,He doesnt have to change much just make sure enforcement was fair across the board The whole problem was people getting preferential treatment While others got the opposite depending on different factors If you say racism isnt allowed that includes the posts about white and Asian people and if that isnt enforced then clearly there is bias Thats just one example and it happens everywhere including reddit,2
19,I can imagine China has a particularly strong hold over him if he wants to keep selling cars in the PRC,3
20,Your imagining he cares about the EU lol,3

7,Love it I d my original account I had had for over a decade the day they banned the sitting POTUS and today Ive created a new account Wont hesitate to leave again if Elon turns out to be a huge failure but Ill be going back and forth between twitter and Truth now,16
8,2022 has been a great year for cancelling wokeness CNN cancelled Disneys special tax status cancelled Rachel Maddow cancelled herself Obamas on Spotify cancelled Twitters bias policing of tweets cancelled Will Smith cancelled I added this for giggles ,15

18,First time Im considering making an account and I hate social media,3
19,This actually makes me super happy I might actually use Twitter now Maybe Probably notBut more of a chance than before,2
20,Pretty hilarious all the leftists are freaking out because one of many  Social Media giants might stop being a place for them to mutually masturbate in comforting echochambers where they can rely on liberal execs silencing truth so they can concentrate on having the strongest circle jerk hateorgasms possible,2
0,Divides fansSo the free speech proponents are upset he used his free speech Got it Moving on,408
1,Hes right tho He had to put up Tesla shares as collateral so if TSLA falls the shareholders will have to make up the differenceEdit apparently I have fundamentally misunderstood how this works,187
2,But what does Ja Rule think,187
3,According to the Bolivian government and its allies as well as international observers Elon Musk partly backed the 2019 fascist coup in order to acquire the countrys lithium reserves This came after the socialist government decided to nationalize their lithium reserves and crack down on the use of child labor to mine lithium The fascists claimed voter fraud and yet the socialists were reelected back into all branches of government in a massive landslide,126
4,People get upset when celebrities criticize others Not only is Liu using free speech which so many soapbox for unless it goes against what they think Liu also has an HBA so its not like has no credentials,90
5,  Its not your money and it shouldnt be Musks either billionaires shouldnt exist on earth or mars where poverty exists We solve poverty  world hunger and homelessness Then billionaires can go back to existing,88
6,It goddamn is my money It came from subsidies and manipulated Americans,68
7,I definitely like Simu better More authentic,57
8,All that money and I still havent seen a picture of him with a good haircut,18
9,Its so funny to me that people on the internet want to anonymously say whatever shit they want without any repercussion and simultaneously want to hold public figures accountable and have them explain themselves If people online didnt have the luxury of anonymity they wouldnt say more than half the shit they do,12
10,The title has a quote of what he said but that quote doesnt exist in the article I was most interested to see why it isnt his money A million ads and unrelated content to wade through only to be left with nothing interesting What a waste of time,8
11,Its not his money either He pocketed his wealth by exploiting workers not paying taxes and being born wealthy Nobody earns literal Billions of dollars by themselves,6
12,Simus Disney paychecks are cashing just fine Im sure Disney is faaaaar from a morally pure corporation Simu should convince Disney to stop making ShangChi movies and use that money to solve societal problems,5
13,Crazy to me he can throw away 44bn for a website that works fine instead of doing good with it Even if it doesnt work fine its not worth 44bn to fix,4
14,I seem to miss the part of the article where he says whose money it actually is In any case it didnt vanish go tell the sellers to solve world hunger with that same money,1
15,This guy gets outraged for fun,3
16,He has a point what Elon does with his money is his business,3
17,Simu Liuand Doug,2
18,Did he divide Marvel fans  I still love Marvel,2

4,Oh no he has a planStep 1make every tweet racistStep 2ban pronounsStep 3every tweet has the n word,8
5,Once you start riding a tiger its hard to get off,6

3,uj you mean to tell me this isnt a deepfake ,90
4,uj the original music on this clip was so top tier what is this shit,56
5,uj this clip isnt actually Elon,34
6,i only know this isnt elon because he gets in a mustang otherwise he is scarily the same,24

15,Is he really d the Twitter Stan account,2
16,Youre telling me this isnt elon musk,2
17,why does elon look so yassified god damn,2
18,I wonder if Elon employs body doubles Or would he be afraid of them trying to usurp him,2
19,if Stan twitter gets banned where will this sub get its daily content,2
20,,1
0,d,157
1,Why do you think the left is so enraged  They dont have Twitter in their back pocket to hide their corruption and amplify their lies like four years of the Russian collusion hoax  Not one person was banned for pushing that bullshit,140
2,The largest scandal in US history    Media climbing over themselves  frothing at the bit to be the first ones to cover it up,66
3,So Elon is for real Hes not just a troll it sounds like hes not messing around when he said hes going to bring free speech back to the platform,58
4,,41
5,You bet This was the very definition of censorship Considering the timing of the story it very likely would have affected the 2020 election and Joe Bidens supposedly 81 million  votesOnly some 20000 or so votes cast differently in certain key states would have left hiding Biden in his Hitlerian bunker in Delaware where he belongs,39
6,Wat are lefties saying about this Tweet,20
7,It wasnt just suspending NY Post Algorithmic demotion bans shadow bans randomly locking accounts they were full blown code red trying to prevent people from sharing a factual news story,17
8,Elon Musk Now every bad there is in Lefties Vocabulary That just means Job Well Done Bidens Paid the Lady well for her Election Lock in more than Joes 10 for sure,8
9,Im getting more and more optimistic about ElonIm still uneasy about the sort of power that this dude has though I definitely did NOT see all this coming,8
10,In addition to allowing the very fine people hoax to continue unchecked  Its called election interference and supposedly illegal when the left accuses you of it,6
11,Hey ElonKnock it offThat was Different,5
12,Direct election interference that couldve changed as many as 1 in 6 Biden votes is more than just inappropriate,5
13,The Hunter Biden laptop story is what got me permanently banned from Reddit on a different account For simply posting a link to a news article Now that everyone can post the same story Why cant I have that account unbanned,5
14,Musk doesnt know Something something bUt TrUmP so its OK something something,3
15,Music to my fucking ears,2
16,Inappropriate isnt the word Id use but I still agree nonetheless,3
17,Before we start believing this is good remember hes a businessman Hes gonna say whatever it takes to get people to return to Twitter so he can sell more ads and get more data He can talk all he wants what matters is his actual actions Wouldnt be the first time his mouth wrote checks he couldnt cash,3
18,This whole Twitter saga is annoying   All parties involved are annoying and self centered   Who even actually uses Twitter besides celebrities   The whole platform is a propaganda machine   Truth is irrelevant to both side,1
19,Master understatement,1
20,Yes Yes it was,1

6,Perso jen est rien a pt du fantasque Elon mais je suis un passionn despaces et sur le secteur des lanceurs je dois avouer que cest SpaceX si SpaceX a SpaceX tout court et le gars et vraiment trs impliqu impossible de ne pas entendre parler de lui au moins une fois par semaine pour vous dire jattend mme beaucoup a prochaine visite de Boca Chica avec le youtuber everyday astronaut cest vraiment trs instructif et assez unique davoir ce genre de contenuMon fil Twitter est rempli de gens passionns de spatiale et la plupart naime vraiment pas cette histoire de culte de la personnalit  la Howard Hughes mais reconnaisse bien sr les qualits de lentreprise si vous navez jamais entendu parl delle sachez que la vraie big boss qui fait march SpaceX est une femme Gwyne Shotwell dans le domaine on est fan delle linverse delon trs discrte efficace cest la face prsentable de lentreprise qui negocie avec les clients et elle a fait des choses assez incroyable comme convaincre la NASA de choisir starship comme Lander pour le programme Artmis ou les convaincre de faire vol Crew Dragon sur des Falcon rutiliser une belle gosse quoi,163
7,Roh a va cest pas parce que ce type est juste le plus mgalo de notre poque que cest un mec dangereux Cest vachement cool de pousser des mmes de 15 piges  se lancer dans la spculation en faisant des memes Et puis eh entre nous maintenant quon a presque fini de niquer notre plante comment on va faire pour pourrir les autres si on a pas un twittos pour nous y emmener  De toute faon tes jaloux parceque lui il est riche et pas toi,158
8,Cest quand mme un gros bb dont le seul mrite est davoir hrit de la fortune de ses parents les fameuses mines dmeraudes dAfrique du SudSoit a soit il a du tout grer seul entre les petits boulots et les bourses de son universit canadienne jusqu son doc de physique  Stanford University son pre lui ayant coup les vivres Aprs vrification il a reu 28000 dollars du paternel pour lancer sa premire entreprise comme son frre Donc beaucoup moins que le prix de ses tudes aux USA Je ne le dfends pas particulirement le bonhomme mindiffre le mensonge pas,89
9,Opinion impopulaire du coup vraisemblablement  il a pris des paris risqus engageant sa fortune et lui faisant risquer la banqueroute  Tesla et SpaceX ces deux entreprises poursuivent un but final plutt noble soit la popularisation des vhicules lectriques pour diminuer les missions de GES et la rduction du cot daccs  lespace qui aide la science  progresserJe le comparerai plutt  Howard Hugues qu Tesla ou Edison de par les risques pris sur ses investissements Aussi je comprends quon puisse ne pas particulirement lapprcier mais de l  linsulter je trouve a moyen,89
10,Il y a bien des fanatiques de Trump qui seraient prt  se jeter dun pont pour lui Jai arrt dessayer de comprendre cette adoration pour les mgalomanes ultra riche a me dpasse,78
11,Tsais Twitter cest trs important dans la vie des journalistes,79
12,Musk est un gros con mais de l  dire quil na jamais rien fait faut pas pousser non plusQuant  son seul mrite est davoir hrit de la fortune de ses parents les fameuses mines dmeraudes dAfrique du Sud vu que ses deux parents sont vivants il risque pas davoir hrit  Et mme si son pre la effectivement aid  financer sa premire bote a nenlve rien au fait que Musk a eu trs tt et bien avant dautres lintuition quon pouvait se faire des couilles en or sur internet,74
13,La comparaison avec Edison est assez juste du coup,67
14,En fait moi personellement quand jai commenc a connatre le type et  entendre parler de lui cest vrai que jen ai plutt eu une bonne image je dirais que a date de 20152016 environ  Et  lpoque il semblait donner des coups de pied au cul  la NASA en mode Vous branlez rien et cherchez des excuses laissez moi faire et semblait vraiment avoir un intrt sincre pour la conqute spatialeJavais particulirement apprci lorsquun autre milliardaire avait fait un post sur Twitter disant en gros quil se lanait aussi dans le spatial avec comme objectif denvoyer quelquun sur Mars avant Musk ce  quoi Musk avait rpondu Do it ce qui me laissait vraiment penser quil considrait la conqute spatiale non pas comme une guerre dgo mais comme une avance peu importe qui laccomplit le premierEn plus de cela les vhicules Tesla ont gnralement une bonne image on peut critiquer comme on veut mais les vhicules lectriques cest quand mme tenter de faire un effort environnemental mme si cest pas 100 propre les fameuses fonctions auto pilote qui sont paraitils surprenantes la clim quand tu laisses les animaux  lintrieur avec lcran qui prvient tout a tout a Donc en vrit ctait difficile pour moi lorsquil tait oppos  Bezos Zuckerberg etc etc de me dire que ctait un milliardaire comme les autresMaintenant on peut clairement se dire quil y a eu un focus trs prcis sur les bons points pour lui donner une bonne image mais quil na rien dun gnie et il ne mrite certainement pas dtre idolatrEdit je prfre ajouter a en me relisant jai compltement chang dide sur le mec quand jai vu toutes les polmiques quil a eu par la suite jai pas parl des mauvais points mais je ne le soutiens ni le dfends je voulais juste apporter un explication sur pourquoi il a eu une image populaire,63
15,Comme tu las not en dit il na ps hrit de son pre vu quil sest fait couper les vivres aprs avoir pris la nationalit Canadienne Sa premire fortune vient de la cration puis de la vente de Zip2 pour plusieurs centaines de millions de  Rebelotte avec XcomPayPal qui fait de lui un miliardaire Cest encore lui qui fonde SpaceX en 2002 pareil pour Neuralink et Boring Company Finalement ses seuls achats significatifs de socits cest Tesla qui ntait pas grand chose en 2004 au moment du rachat et maintenant Twitter Il est peut tre fou mais on ne fonde pas autant de compagnies lgendaires sans tre sacrment dou,64
16,Je trouve que justement dans lautre sens internet et surtout reddit enfin cest peut tre juste que cest le rseau que je frquente le plus a une norme trique de dtester ce gars aprs lavoir compltement idolatrLa relecture rvisioniste de son histoire en mode cest juste un fils  papa qui a hrit de blood money et la investi sans jamais rien inventer est toute aussi ridicule que la comparaison avec Nikola Tesla Il y a quelque chose quil fait bien mieux que tout le  monde et qui est  la croise du personal branding dun certain flair dans linvestissement et la conduite du business et du talent pour sentourer de personnes exceptionnelles pour pousser les objectifs quil a Si on donnait le mme dpart  10 000 personnes dans le monde et bien  la sortie il ny aurait pas 10 000 Elon MuskOn prsente a comme tant moins noble que lingnieurinventeur mais Il a juste investi dans des boites quil a rachet a veut rien dire linvestissement cest une pratique trs difficile et concurrentielles tout comme le marketing Diriger les boites cest pareil cest pas cest facile quand on est riche  cest trs dur On pourrait aussi bien dire de Nikola Tesla Il a rien dploy il a juste invent des trucs dans son garage et ce serait galement ridicule ya pas de hirarchie entre les talents humains il faut de toutCeci tant dit cest un gros connard avec un go surdimensionn et son mauvais got touche plus souvent la stratosphre que les launchers SpaceX Et bien sr au niveau social cest un ultracapitaliste ultralibral avec tous les vices que a implique Oui dans la vie on peut tre virtuose de certaines choses mdiocre dans dautres et carrment pourri dans dautres Faut arrter avec ce truc dinternet o une personne est soit le prochain Christ cosmique soit littralement Hitler,58
17,a doit tre une histoire de bulle parce que moi je ne vois que des critiques et des moqueries  son gard,62
18,Il a surf sur les trucs  la mode  la voiture lectrique cest cool et mme si son vritable parcours est rpt en boucle sur Reddit il y a encore pas mal de gens qui le mettent dans la case inventeur fouGenre ils pensent que cest un ingnieur surdou qui a mont sa premiere Tesla dans son garageTu oublies dailleurs ses accusations de pdophilies profres envers les sauveteurs en Thailande qui avaient expliqu que personne navait besoin de son sousmarin de poche pour aller sauver les gosses dans la grotteOu ses honteuses manipulations du cours de Tesla via Twitter He les mecs le cours est trop bas je vais tout racheter et passer la boite privePanique de la bourse Explosion du titreNon je dconnais Ah lalala la SEC se fache pour rien de nos jours,39
19,Je ne sais pas combien il a reu mais il a incroyablement fait fructifier son capital de dpart Ce qui nest dj pas la norme pour les hritagesDonc indpendamment de sa personnalit discutable il a clairement su prendre des risques bien calculs sur plusieurs sujets diffrents sur plusieurs priodes diffrentes Sur le fond que peuton lui reprocher l dessus  Il a au moins ce talent Si cest un connard il suffit de ne pas acheter de tesla de ne pas voyager en space x et bientt de ne plus lire TwitterPar parenthse Twitter a dj t aux mains de milliardaires contestables ceux qui lont conu ltant devenus notamment celui qui ressemble  un Christophe Ma rchauff au micro ondes,36

0,Twitter is a dumpster fire  life is a lot better without it,338
1,Twitters already a shithole and I guess it itll just get shittier Honestly Im worried most about politicians I do not want to see the return of RealDonaldTrump and I really dont want them to be able to edit their tweets honestly Unfortunately righties only support freeze peach when its their peach being frozen,233
2,This isnt going to go well for trans Twitter Musk has some plan to authenticate Twitter users What does he mean by that Does he expect users to identify themselves using official ID Will users be forced to display their real names Anonymity is a matter of safety for trans folk so anything like that is going to result in an exodus from the site Maybe thats what Musk wants,137
3,I have been wondering what to do about this  Leave Twitter now or wait until the antihate policies are formally rescindedThe only microblogging alternative I know of is Mastodon but that really needs a better newusers experience  And a good way to seek out people you used to follow on TwitterGranted the bigger problem  as youre saying  isnt that well be attacked while on Twitter its that haters will goad one another into more dramatic hate and eventually violence  Dont know what we can do about that though,108
4,I think this CNN opinion piece raises a valid point  cnncom20220425opinionstwittermusktakeoverinternetalaimoindexhtmlTheres already 4chan if people want to yell fire in a crowded theater,82
5,Musk is just pissy that Grimes is now with a trans woman thats far superior to himFuck him and fuck Twitter,75
6,Yeah I just noped tf out of twitter We need protections online and Musk needs to give them,75
7,Its awful for all people Thats why I never joined or used it,51
8,The US government wasnt part of the decision making process for Musk buying Twitter that was up to the board of Twitter itself The SEC could theoretically jam up the works because of Musks missing his filing deadline caused him to essentially cause a run on stock that made him millions of dollars through irregular trading but our government doesnt really prosecute financial crimes otherwise Trump never would have been able to run for president in the first place Twitter is one somewhat unimportant companymarketingtool and it hasnt been a safe platform to be vocally trans female a person of color or a member do the disabled community It has gotten safer but its still not safe and hate free Will it get less safe Maybe Maybe not Musk can and probably will ruin Twitter in some dumb way but there are always other social media companies If anything this is likely to cause more migration to insta and TikTok than cause actual harm to our community Bigots are perfectly able to communicate on all their terrible networks including most mainstream social media They just might be dogwhistling instead of yelling in some cases Unfortunately until first time Twitter facilitates terrorism the government likely wont step in and demand strict regulation with it being taken back to a private instead of public company Heck you could argue that Jan 6th was facilitated by Facebook and Twitter already and yet nothing has been done Thankfully this country is able to appoint more regulation friendly governors into the SEC the Biden administration just has to actually do it Musk may then be held accountable for some of his financial duckery as he has been dancing around rules and regulations for a while But in all likelihood hed just leave the country and go somewhere that doesnt extradite if he somehow lost a multiyear legal battle with the US government What would actually hurt him is his pocketbook If Twitter lost him 43 Billion dollars Id say thats a better use for the platform than I can think of Ill just go somewhere elseEdited,37
9,It sucks because I left Twitter when all the terfs started coming onto it and I only just came back this year and Ive made plenty of friends with other trans folks there and now just as things were starting to get good this shit happens I hope we get another platform to move to,42
10,Him breaking up with Grimes is really affecting us a lot more than I thought it would,36
11,Why are goverments willing to give billionaires and corporations so much power in regards to media Because they dont work for you they work for billionaires and corporations Its a feature of the system not a bug,34
12,a comment I saw about him buying twitterI would say musk taking twitter private is very good Elon is taking it private fact checking Thats gonebanning somoene cause they hurt ones feelings thats gonehe goes one to say facebook is too heavily modded insaneBut I have NEVER FUCKING SEEN ANYONE think throwing fact checking out the window is a good thing My brain fucking meltedSo yeah twitter is bad Its going to become a center of hate and misinformation,33
13,Honestly Twitter never felt safe  They ban trans women who argue with TERFs more than they ban transphobesThe biggest way this deal makes me unhappy is that the vile rich slaver feels like he is winning  but Im not going to mind watching him trash Twitter  Good riddance to a bad platform,30
14,I just used it as an excuse to  mine once and for all Twitter allows so a ton of aggressively transphobic stuff as it is  JK Rowling for example was allowed to constantly post aggressively anti trans posts and nothing was done,26
15,Twitter was already a dumpster fire I dont really interact with it at all,23
16,Okay but consider it this wayYes the day that Elon Musk bought Twitter wad the worst day in Twitter history but it was also the worst day in Twitter history The hellsite will collapse in on itself like s stack of cards,20
17,I fully expect this to kill Twitter They didnt ban these people out of the goodness of their hearts but because it was the right move financially,16
18,I d my Twitter account a couple of hours agoIts not much but its what I could doI wish I could say something optimistic but I really think that these are the End Times ,10
19,im ngl i deactivated today twitter was already incredibly hostile but after this acquisition its just not worth it,11
20,Never used twitter was a dumpster fire as it was and have no intention of using it going forwardElon Musk has no idea what hes doing never seems to fully think things through Twitters going to become a bigger shit hole and something else might hopefully take its place,9
0,The not that kind of free speech leftists are out in force today Sheesh,121
1,Not a big fan of the guy but damn am I grateful for all the entertainment  this is going to provide over the coming weeks ,60
2,Already knocking it out of the park The left is going to bring the hate Cant wait to see it,51
3,Theyre running scared shitting their diapers over the loss of their precious echo chamber,18
4,Unless they want to form a union lmao,7
5,The leftists only want to hear their own views  anything else is fascism,8
6,Hed be such a legend if he spent that odd billion or so and d Twitter Ah one can dream,3
7,Nooooooo we cant have people disagreeing with the correct viewpoint,2
8,Lol even his worst critics guy wouldnt even keep one of his employees who criticized his cars,2
9,Ah man if he just wanted to buy Twitter I wouldnt really care as its not a platform I use its not a format I enjoy and its not the great sphere of discussion and dialogue people seem to treat it as  So to me Elon is making a business decision and thats fineWhat I dislike because it seems so unbelievably flawed and nonsensical is this argument that hes doing it for Free Speech  Spending 44 Billion dollars isnt remotely necessary if your goal was a free speech platform  Globally the most oppressed people as far as speech is concerned arent using TwitterWhen it comes to a free speech platform a 1Billion dollar start up could have achieved that goal  Hire 250 million dollars worth of Sr Web Architects and guarantee hosting costs and equipment are covered and voila A Twitter Clone Free Speech behemoth  He has the popularity to attract people to the platform whereas other startups who have tried have failed including PetersonSo its this narrative that hes some kind of a hero that bothers me  Well wait and see what comes from all of this but I wont be celebrating this as some marvelous movement towards better and more open dialogueAs much as I loathe the term virtue signalling the marketing behind this purchase is a perfect example of it,2
10,Even for the unions successfully organising using twitterI hope so,1
11,Of course he does Collecting the most data points as possible from as many population segments as possible to feed into algorthym psychometric data  is  and power,1
12,They wont because they only like debating when their opponents are unable to respond,1
13,Jock dorsey says he trusts Elons vision for it,1
14,Damn good thing we are human and not expected to be perfect Just capable of not completely destroying things Pretty much the only requirement for a leader these days And I would say he isnt perfect but his intentions do not seem evil His intentions seem good in nature and seem to align with my opinion of the greater good So for that reason I can admire him,1
15,Its free speech if your best critics are allowed to stay,1
16,How was twitter against free speech I thought free speech just meant the government couldnt interfere with your right to speech Twitter isnt the government,1
17,Muskrats in here too,1
18,Elon needs to buy Facebook now  SAVE US ELON,1
19,We did it ladies and gentlemenWe gottem,1
20,So what Can you imagine how that much money could have been spent Just a lot of hot air,1

1,Were supposed to expect gov officials to fix all the issues but weve learned to stop being surprised when they do the opposite Elon literally told everyone he would solve world hunger and just fucking didnt no one is crying no one is surprised lol,362
2,Tesla wouldnt exist without government tax payer welfare he received but lets call it his own money,104
3,To be fair most of those trillions were spent propping up western oligarchs by fighting forever wars That being said it would have been nice if the emerald fortune heir could do something benevolent,43
4,Whos the guy on the left,37
5,His own moneyElon Musk will be the most indebted CEO in America if the Twitter deal goes through cnbccom20220428elonmuskwillbemostindebtedceoinamericaiftwitterdealcloseshtmlElon Musks deal to take Twitter Inc private will nearly triple the socialmedia companys leverage and saddle it with hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payable on the more than 25 billion used to fund the leveraged buyout wsjcomarticleselonmusksbuyoutwillloadtwitterwithdebthighleverageratio11651007981,31
6, Why didnt you solve all the world problems Well Musk is propagating himself as some savior or humanity that will stop climate change and realoccate humanity to Mars     And you know when you promise and dont deliver people will don like you,22
7,I believe this was in reference to Elon asking how much it would cost to end hunger or something like that I believe the UN put a dollar amount on there and a subset of the internet got pissed because he made it seem like he would pay to end that problemIn reality I dont think musk is that great The right is fascinated with him because hes an edge lord when it comes to memes but they too will one day realize he doesnt actually care about them,18
8,At least they are acknowledging that Trump squandered a lot of money Baby steps people,13
9,My god youre right  None of us has ever criticized how the US government spends money  Major oversight on our part really we dropped the ball on this one,10
10,I think people have rightly criticized how he openly offers to help social issues and then does nothing while spending way more to acquire something for his own ego and control This dude told the UN hed pay 6B if they could provide a detailed plan for how to end world hunger for that cost They did He ghosted Dude said hed get Flint clean water sent bottles instead of dropping a few million on new pipes Hes all hat and no cowboy when it comes to shit that matters,8
11,They also didnt spend 54 trillion of my money Ive never had that much money but if I had 55 trillion I would probably be okay with them taking 54 trillion if it went towards better education and healthcare,3
12,People always miss the key points that anyone who amasses billions essentially stole that money through wage slavery and exploitation,4
13,I thought The Right loved Trump,3
14,Didnt he promise to spend 6 billion to cure world hunger if someone else drew up the plansNow he is spending 44bn on twitter instead,3
15,His own money LMAO HE leveraged Tesla stock to get a LOAN That aint his money,3
16,He does say hes a socialist,2
17,Funnily enough after his announcement to purchase twitter for that amount it may not happenhes thinking about backing out because Tesla stock is starting to go down hill which means he has less to borrow against Also how the fck is Twitter worth that much,2
18,So NOW they want us to be mad at the other rich fucknuts,2
19,Elon is the jackass who keeps saying hell solve the worlds problems remember when he said hed fix the Flint water crisis,2
20,Why do they think theres a meltdown like this ,2
0,haha biggest race baiter ever How he has any relevance today is beyond me,544
1,Hes just jealous that Elon Musk is a real African American,479
2,Twitter getting better by the minute,462
3,He is probably one of the most racist people on Twitter good news that he left,253
4,Reminder that Talcum X is white,236
5,No Stop Come back,163
6,Im sure the twitter sphere will really miss Martin Luther Cream,93
7,Elon is African American,71
8,I dont get it is he is a white person in denial,65
9,Yes yes we know Everything is about white power I used real sugar on my corn flakes this morning and sugar is white so therefore white power,65
10,Trash taking itself out,31
11,Hell be back in less than a week He cant grift selling his books or making money off dead people without social media,28
12,Sounds about white,24
13,Buh bye Talcum X,16
14,Never heard of him,15
15,Racist Talcum X OUT OUT OT,13
16,Yeah it was sooo much better when twitter was owned by wallstreet firms and saudi princes,9
17,A bargain at 42 billion,11
18,Talcum X,11
19,Their absence will make the platform a better place good riddance to bad rubbish as my granny used to say,10
20,Who is Shaun King  Why do we care,8
0,I got an even better deal I never installed it,221
1,Literal LOL Good one,95
2,You should tweet this,41
3,When the Product is Free Youre the Product,16
4,Happened to Microsoft Mojang totally scammed them I can go and get minecraft for just 35,13
5,Good old joke number 14,6
6,You kids and your tweeters and blueberry smart phones Good grief,5
7,Elon over here playing checkers while I play chess,2
8,Buying Twitter for 43 billionSupposed Cough SurfingRich Fucking Mooch doesnt pay any fucking taxes,2
9,I installed Twitter and it doesnt do anything useful  Ill probably  it when Im done yelling at politicians,2
10,Well clearly this is major news But my question is what exactly does it mean when he buys it Does that mean Twitter is going to go in a different direction Anybody have any comments,2
11,Now he can finally travel without the bot posting his planes location,2
12,Elon Musk got PRANKED,1
13,Some businessman he is,1
14,Im surprised how many people havent already heard this joke but for a different app,1
15,I hope so because I heard Elon is a down to Mars guy,1
16,man this one got me  well done,1
17,He really knows how to twitter his money away,1
18,We gonna repeat this joke every single time a rich person buys a popular company that has a free appIt was funny the first time when Microsoft bought Minecraft,1
19,Oh neat the same joke from last week Hahaha,1
20,Wow this is truly awful just terrible,1
0,Free speech is good and all but Twitter is a place that is full of what I consider shit speech It is why I avoid the site entirely lol everyone there is nuts,563
1,I quit Twitter years ago No offense to anybody who still uses the platform I never understood the appeal when I was on it and Musk buying it makes it less attractive as a service Why do people keep using it Whats the appeal,338
2,When they say they want Free Speech it usually means they want the ability to harass and misgender with impunity online I dont feel like Twitter even tried hard to curb it before musk but i feel like its gonna quickly make Twitter a worse place for everyone especially us ,257
3,Get off the platform for your mental health Its going to get more toxic regardless of what he does simply because of the hype and rhetoric,147
4,i think you should get off twitter asap,115
5,When rightwingers say freespeech they mean consequencefree harassment Im not willingly going to be their punching bag so I d my account I think itll take a while but eventually nonmarginalized people will grow tired of the abuse and rightwingers will get bored with their selfcreated echo chamber and itll die out like MySpace and Facebook,97
6,We have no idea at this time Hes only talked about verifying all humans and getting rid of bot swarms as well as making the algorithm open source so everyone can see itNo word on moderation solutions or on how to prevent harassment or if he believes that free speech means it must be heard by the person its directed at We know nothing except that Elon Musk loves to use alt right dog whistles and has offered to buy out plane tracking Twitter accounts he doesnt like His past behavior seems very anti free speech to me but he clearly is the one who is going to decide what it means for Twitter,62
7,I realize this qualifies as a hot take but I cant stress enough how much I mean it Twitter is going to be toxic no matter whoever owns it and the best thing you can do is just not be part of it just like Facebook Tik Tok etc Its not an i hate social media thing its a realization of why the fuck do i bother with this thing,58
8,Transphobia trends on Twitter every day Im sure Musk will make it worse but its already a nightmare,48
9,I was permabanned there for saying something about TERFs and shovels  I hadnt realized twitter considered bigots to be a vulnerable classTwitter has never protected us  Its a cesspool thats only going to get filthier,37
10,I think things might be a bit worse but if it gets too bad a bunch of people will leave I cant see them letting it get to the point where corporations or celebrities dont want to post there anymore,33
11,Like Facebook waste of your time and energy  it and youll be happier I have this this is enough ,15
12,As a really active Twitter user I think things will probably stay as they are Theres plenty of hate already prevalent a lot of gatekeeping and even a really large group of trans people who gatekeep themselves Hate comes from all sides  all we can do is be kind and hope people will be kind in turn,15
13,Twitter was already pretty much over Im moving on,11
14,I think we have enough stuff to worry about already so Im not going to waste my thoughts on what could happen,10
15,Im convinced that he is going to unban Trump and then Trump will rally his followers once again and the United States as we know it will be destroyed,9
16,i have a feeling the site is going to experience a mass exodus lmaox200Bnever had an account there myself now im glad i didnt bother,8
17,So one of the reasons I saw that Elon bought Twitter was because one of his favorite transphobic Twitter accounts got banned for of course being transphobic I guarantee he will bring it back and create even worse environments for us it seems like he loved using us for humor ,10
18,Donald Trump is likely to be unbanned Shows you all you need to know and that Babylon Bee isnt far behind either,8
19,Literally no where online is safe for trans people,7
20,i think im not gonna use twitter anymore,9
0,Thread locked due to a high amount of political commentary  personal attacks,1
1, This was a fast turnaround from their poison pill if trueI think this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what a poison pill is forThe poison pill is the board of directors saying if youre gonna buy the company you have to go through us come negotiate directly with us instead of trying to acquire a controlling stake on the open market,639
2,This might be a dumb question but this means the company will now be private right,284
3,Damn kinda blows my mind that a single individual has the resources to purchase a public company worth 40 billion with his personal fortune lmao,225
4,And many people here thought its a dump and pump scheme This is good news to TWTR shareholders as the stock went nowhere since IPO,149
5,Does this mean were gonna see daily fucking Trump tweets as news again,87
6,I really dont like this timeline where rich people are buying all the megaphones to control democracy,66
7,I dont understand why the board would accept an offer thats about 8 above current trading prices granted theres been a bit of a run up the past couple weeks But this is significantly lower than ATH prices around this time last year Does the board really believe TWTR would never recover to where it was trading last year Musks offer just seems so modest compared to potential What am I missing,35
8,Can someone explain what happens to people who own twitter stock Are you forced to sell it at X price Seems shitty if true,23
9,Stock is trading right now at 51 and change may have changed by the time anyone reads this or indeed as I type this message Musks offer is 54 and change Is this free money if you buy the stock now Similar but likely not really to arbitrageAm I missing something Is there a downside Im not seeing,24
10,I will say this again the idea that anyone would pay 43 billion dollars for the made public best left unsaid private thoughts of Ben Shapiro and his ilk is absolutely insaneMy thoughts arent even worth a penny and its not like Thomas Paine and Alexander Hamilton are still around to give us brilliant social commentary in real time Most things you read on Twitter make you want to put your head in a vicePurchasing Twitter is so mindbogglingly stupid I cant even as the kids say This isnt even a free speech issue as the first amendment applies to restrictions placed upon the citizenry by the government not a shitty Web 20 hasbeen If I want to hear boomers racist thoughts Ill just go on Twitter for freeFor contrast Tesla paid 42 million for the NUMMI plant a steal that has been an enormous value generator Would he have paid 42 billion for the NUMMI plant No because that would have been the workings of an insane mindNo idea why this angers me so much probably because I will want to laugh at the inevitable Twitter writedownwriteoff but I promised my wife I would stop being such an asshole Venti is twenty large is large,18
11,Wow This is shocking news,18
12,Who would have thought all these years Twitter struggled to monetize the site all they had to do was attract the attention of a billionaire egomaniac to buy them out,15
13,I really dont understand this Meta bought IG back in 2012 for 1B which is like 12B in todays money Twitter is not going to be 40x more profitable than something like that Maybe its not about the money,16
14,I wonder why the sudden turnaround  Might have been the threat of legal action,12
15,Good for the shareholders but man will it get ugly for all of the right wing twitter knockoffs,12
16,Twitter managementshareholders should take the offer and run to the bank  I dont see it going back to its last year high anytime soon  Its eerily similar to Yahoo in the 2000s when they rebuked Microsofts 40B offer only to sell to Verizon for pennies a few years laterAs they say a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,11
17,I know this may sound a bit unconventional but I used to listen to a podcast called according to sources They used to make money off takeover rumours by betting against them going through So Im tempted to buy a couple of out of the money puts as a hedge or bet,12
18,25 for 45ea doesnt sound so dumb now,9
19,Elections and stock crypto manipulation is controlled inhouse now Sad days ahead,3
20,43 billion for software that has a bunch of people that use it to say things Insane,2
0,If killing all of the bots saves Twitter and makes not awful sweet If killing all the bots kills Twitter too also sweet,679
1,This is what I think the deal is with Elons takeover he will eliminate the bots and make Twitter the ultimate data mining hive mind His goal is to use this data to build his Neuralink AI get ready for Skynet 2027removing tinfoil hat now,339
2,Where will the scammers flee to,111
3,Not a bad thing Upvotes downvotes and followers will be more difficult to fake,89
4,If you listen to Musks interviews around this over the past 69mths the thing he is targeting are bot farms that manipulate public discourse My bet is he will impliment a 2 stage verification process Stage 1  Financial barrier of entry So all new accounts will require a token financial amount to create the account for example  2 Not the end of the world if your a real user but if your a bot farm registering 1 million accounts that barrier of entry can make a real difference This stage would require ZERO ID verification but you can never get a blue check mark Stage 2  Blue check mark  Essentially KYC Submit 100 points of ID and pay a 5 verification fee You then get checked and verified and a blue check mark to show you are a REAL person Once again financial barrier of entry for bot farms,60
5,LOL Elon wants KYC for Twitter This sub must be so conflicted right now,54
6,This is exactly what Saylor said on Lex Fridmans show 2 weeks ago Saylors argument was make everyone pay 10 once for their account making it prohibitively expensive for bot farms to spin up tens of thousands of bot accounts,22
7,This will be the death of Twitter,22
8,I posted this on polygons subreddit but I think this is a perfect opportunity for polys ZK identification solution so dont FUD this whole need to authenticate Could work out ok too,19
9,depends on what he means really  the devil is in the details some kind of Turing test fine if they require personally identifying information guess ill stop using twitter,15
10,This is literally KYC why would the crypto community advocate for this,14
11,Say it with me billionaires on twitter are not your friendThat said maybe destroying twitter wouldnt be the worst thing ever,11
12,LOL The fanbois who S E C  He wants to authenticate you the same clowns who always brag about how private XMR is  Who run around spouting this or that about anonymity in Crypto  And now you are jumping in line because he wants to authenticate who you are so the government can track your crypto And so he can sell all your information to his best pal Xi Pooh who coincidentally Elon allows censorship from in exchange for car salesAs much as the idea of authenticating crypto for everyday use and allowing regulation to occur occasionally appeals to me personally as it could be helpful in limiting illegal activity and ending scams and forcing assholes to pay their fair sharethe fact that the idiots in this sub have jumped ship so quickly is startling and makes me wonder if I might be wrong,8
13,Is Reddit ever going to stop sucking this guy off The fact everyone on this platform swallows whatever loaf this guy dumps on them is cringe,7
14,Crypto scammers should take notice,6
15,sorry elon I only sell my identity to crypto sites,5
16,Owning Twitter already gives Musk a minefield of personal datagiving him your personal info is dangerous That will be the day I leave Twitter if not before I will not give him access to my personal information just to be on a social media app He even said he wants people to use their real names No Ill pass,6
17,You dumbasses here are actually rooting for this 1984 shit because of bots  Lol go back to fortnite,4
18,Elon Musk wantsElon Musk wants,3
19,I think its more of a make authentication easier to access than force everyone to authenticateBut we will see If thats the case then Elon can get fucked,2
20,Were all gonna be nfts weather we like it or not,4
0,The cycle of this sub is great  We are back in the old people Facebook meme phase,912
1,I havent really seen anyone give much of a fuck about this tbh,441
2,All these people live rentfree in your culture war damaged brainLmao,289
3,As an actual leftist I dont really care about what musk is doing I am tired of hearing about him though,145
4,Just another reminder that this is DEFINITELY NOT A RIGHT WING SUB DEFINITELY NOTAnyway back to scrolling for months to see if I can find anything other than boomer conservative memes from the dumbest of facebook pages,110
5,Ridiculously rich guy uses his wealth and power to gobble up yet another propertyShockingThis isnt about leftists Its about how little you have in this world and how much power the rich haveYoure fucked,59
6,Great since were doing edits of bombastic reactions now make a montage of triggered republicans burning their Nikes or Keureg pods orGillette razorsorliterally anything else where the company says words they dont agree with lol,60
7,At least the first amendment will be finally realized Twitter will not prohibit freedom of speech I must have been reading the constitution wrong my entire life thinking free speech had to deal with the government,57
8,Conservatives when they realize gay people exist,54
9,Leftist here twitter sucks elon sucks it all sucks,45
10,Third from the left on top is actually screaming about Trump losing Im sure shes excited as fuck Talmbout mUh freeze peach bapa,27

12,The bottom row 2nd to left is the meme guy from ages agoand I doubt any of these are real,19
13,Havent really seen much of anyone on the left actually reacting to this Ive seen a bunch of conservative whining and trying to manufacture outrage saying that the left is freaking out and trying to make this a left versus right thing for some reason Kind of just seems like a bunch of snow flakes that want to make everything in life be a left vs right situation Sounds like a sad way to live,19
14,Why are people like OP such giant fucking pussiesEdited conservatives to people but fuck OP,12
15,I mean Twitter wasnt committed to free speech originally but I think the idea now is why would the guy whos had 40 labor law violation suits against him and has actively tried to squash union organizers in his companies support free speech when he doesnt even support it within his organizations he already owns I just dont know how people expect somebody with his track record to actually make a free speech platform without some angle that significantly benefits him over others By benefit I dont just mean financial he clearly doesnt need more income,10
16,Conservatives continuing to make up realities in their head,14
17,Or its all the Truth Social investors ,12
18,Can we just ban people who post political Facebook memes,9
19,Its the second lady in the second line always gets me  I thinks thats her reaction after Trump won,6
20,Centrist here looking to see how Im supposed to react,8
0,Section 230,312
1,d,174
2,The true test of this is if he bans the kid that posts his private jets itinerary or not,121
3,But uh Twitter isnt a publisher,59
4,section 230 protects platforms like twitter from libel for statements made by users learn things before you form opinions,56
5,I just use Twitter to yell at Delta and Comcast when they screw something up Faster fixes than calling 800 numbers Now I will be able to hashtag twatwaffle in them  nice,36
6,What do you mean until It gets sued for libel  Why would Twitter itself be posting libel  The person who would get sued for libel would be the person posting the libel not it or Twitter  But go on and circlejerk and upvote this post anyways I guess,28
7,Thats literally what section 230 is for,26
8,Who falls for this kind of fear mongering,21
9,Bad meme This is getting upvotes purely bc Elon bad,18
10,A He is protected B Why are you afraid of free speech,16
11,Takes them over 40 days to remove terrorist accounts,17
12,Anyone who says they can run a platform like Twitter without policing its content is either lying or extremely naive,18
13,Does reddit get sued for libelNope,10
14,this is why most redditors are poor they dont understand how anything works,8
15,Thats like suing ATT if I slander someone on the phone Thats not how it works,8
16,That is free speech thoughLiterally every single case of libel death threats and any other illegal speech must go through the justice system not be handled in private by corporate moderatorsAnyone who is truly for free speech is for this,2
17,Imagine trying to sue for libel for a post on social media That would mean someone could sue Reddit for someone posting the amazing iPhone 8 wirelessly charge your phone in the microwave meme idiot,8
18,The entire point of section 230 immunity is to protect internet platforms from that,4
19,Are we going to start a pool on how long the guy tracking Musks private jet flights is going to last under this free speech,6
20,I mean that was always the point behind not censoring you make the distinction between being a publisher or a platform  You cant sue a platform for libel  A publisher can be,3
0,Odd never heard Dementia Joe mention it once prior to today,635
1,Strange  Biden has been in office long before Al Gore invented the InternetHe has never once stated his concern over social mediaSuddenly now today its of major import,486
2,CoolMaybe we should put some rules in place that force social media companies to protect the 1st amendmentOr maybe we could break up the tech monopolies,365
3,The irony is just so rich at this point They can kick rocks,249
4,I dont care what Party affiliation they are to ban a president of  the United states a position only 46 people have held is absurd,153
5,You have got to fing kidding me   Could these twits be anymore obvious   Anyone but a very deluded individual knows exactly where this bullshit is headed  This week its concern  Next week its they have to be shut down to save democracy  Or shut down those mean tweets cuz someones feelers got hurt  Hurts when your ability to silence critics takes such a huge blow  The amount of hubris these folks have never fails to astound  Asshats,150
6,Its afraid,104
7,Whitehouse is worried,43
8,I may now rejoin Twitter LOL,40
9,You mean as in concerned that they might be able to silence an encumbant President,34
10,Oh NOW they express concern Dude this administration has no backbone So hypocritical,37
11,I was just telling a friend about the 180 the Dems were about to pull on Section 230 Whadya know Hasnt even been 24 hours Shit it hasnt even been 12,29
12,Right now its a problem since the Left is losing one of their censorship machines I see how it works,27
13,Why wasnt this concern voiced before Elon Musk decided to buy Twitter Ill bet its because they were using Twitter and Facebook to silence their opponents and dissenting views The moment somebody decides to go the other way and allow actual open freespeech they have a problem with it,27
14,Annnnnnnd here he go Now all of a sudden theyre going to be focusing on mental health of teens  stating that social media is bad,27
15,6 months ago they where working with social media and NOW they are worried about the power social media has Amazing,22
16,The White House is concerned because theyve been able to subvert the 1st Amendment by directly outsourcing censorship to private companies From today Biden administration officials think tougher scrutiny could prevent the spreading of false information on political issues and the COVID19 pandemic reuterscomtechnologywhitehouseexpressesconcernssocialmediaaftermuskstwitterdeal20220425We engage regularly with all social media platforms about steps that can be taken Psaki added That has continued and Im sure will continue but there are also reforms that we think Congress could take reuterscomtechnologywhitehouseexpressesconcernssocialmediaaftermuskstwitterdeal20220425,22
17,I dont think Joey even knows how to operate Windows 95,19
18,He didnt seemed concerned when social media was suppressing the candidates that they didnt like in 2019 to 2020,19
19,Free speech is a danger to OUR democracy,21
20,They werent at all concerned when liberals had 100 control of virtually all social media Now that they see a potential for actual free speech theyre scared If their formerly captive audience for liberal swill actually are presented with facts and are smart enough to extrapolate the truth democrats are doomed I know I know there are some big ifs in that statement,16
0,Thread locked due to a high amount of political commentary  personal attacks,1
1,I still cant fathom what his actual motivation is for doing thisLike hes buying a 15 year old social media company with 44b of his own money What is the endgameEdit Good lord some of these responses are cringeyYea everyone knows Elon is a selfproclaimed bastion of free speechbecause weve never had someone claim that before while actually just meaning free speech that I like,746
2,I find it amusing that so many people are SURE they know exactly what Musk is up to If nothing else hes shown himself to be quite unpredictable over and over again,378
3,Its 4 premium from its current priceFor a peasant such as myself I guess theres no point holding on to the shares,343
4,I dont think any good can come from this  But maybe we will see a name change in the near futureI am voting for MyspaceX,166
5,His master plan is to Elongate the tweet character limit,128
6,So does this mean the company goes private under Musk  Sorry if I am ignorant on how these things work,128
7,Wonder why its currently trading at a discount at 51 per share,86
8,He has the money simple as is Why is anyone perplexed He thinks he can run it better That is allWe got some really small brain takes here about possible motives blah blah blah,52
9,now we need musk to buy reddit and remove all the mods,50
10,Is there any reason to not buy the stock under that price,35
11,I hope he shutters the whole fucking thing,30
12,,30
13,Im still of the belief this will fall through at some point,23
14,Whats the timeline for this to officially go through I havent seen any dates,22
15,All of Reddit a few weeks ago Elon is a fraud this is a pump and dump,11
16,Must say did not expect that  interesting where Twitter can go from here,11
17,44 billion for a business with 5 billion in revenue that hasnt made a profit in 2 years seems like a poor investment,11
18,Elon is going to add Twitter in all the upcoming Tesla cars,5
19,Got to give it to him the man is ballsy Hope he can turn things around at Twitter,7
20,I dont own shares of twitter And this is a new one for me If I buy shares now before it goes private can I continue investing Do they sell my shares and send me a check Or is this a TBA sort of situationEdit Im probably over thinking it Hes getting ALL the shares right So I wont be able to invest in private twitter,4
0,I didnt leave the Democrat party the Democrat party left me President Ronald Reagan,191
1,Likewise My politcal views are pretty moderate with a Conservative lean But since Trump took office all they did was go at the guy nonfuckingstop force their politics down everyones throats and slander anyone who doesnt completely agree with their agenda So now screw em theres zero chance I ever vote for a liberal or any of their policies again even though Id personally benefit much more from doing so I dont care I want nothing to do with the party anymore Though Im also not someone who refuses to even interact with people who have differing or even moderate political views like some other tolerant people of a certain partyAlso I always find it so amusing when leftists bring up the term farright Like what the hell is that supposed to mean All Conservatism is is just that  conservatism They go hard to the left widen the gap between right and left and then when we dont fully give in to their new progressive demands were farright,115
2,Didnt Trump use to be a Democrat too Joe Rogan is another fascinating quasi Democrat Openly socialist endorsed Sanders 8 years ago now a hero voted libertarian since then and now is a bit of a hero on the right just for allowing a platform for smart people with non mainstream ideas,103
3,Whos surprised The same liberals who want to ban and harass people for midgendering while they proudly display Azov Nazi symbols on their profile to support Ukraine Lol When you search for liberal in the dictionary it refers you to the definition of hypocrisy,39
4,Calling it now The democrats will drive off a cliff of wokeism and the election will be decided in Republican primaries,26
5,Actually true Both sides have gone left Moderates belong with the Rs see the hysterical mistreatment of sen Manchin and Sinema for proof,21
6,No shit the left eat their own isnt an expression that just sprang into existence for no reason,21
7,Hell even Bill Maher says the left has gone too far left,12
8,Classical liberalism is a political and economic ideology that advocates the protection ofcivil libertiesandlaissezfaire economic freedomby limiting the power of the central government Developed in the early 19th century the term is often used in contrast to the philosophy of modern social liberalism,9
9,If the left hasnt gone too far would we at rconservative be considered centrist or even centerleft,8
10,LOLwhat this graph is actually showing is the disappearing middlecenter Everyone who thought they were vaguely center leftright or independent in 2008 has since become politically homeless due to the rapid polarization over the past decade To the far left everyone in the middle is now just right wing I wonder if Bill Maher liked this tweet,8
11,If you are in favor of free speech for all then you must be some kind of NAZI  Orwell was a prophet,6
12,The term that I keep hearing for people like Musk assuming that his statement is true is postliberal These are people who were politically rather liberal on a lot of issues but maybe not all the issues However as the liberals have moved far to the Left these same people didnt move with them and thus got shunned and left behind Because of the shift to the Left they found themselves hanging out with conservatives with whom theyve found themselves agreeing with more and more Prominent examples include Joe Rogan Tim Pool Tulsi Gabbard and now apparently Elon Musk,6
13,I was pro Obama his first term This is me too,6
14,Ive said this a million times  The Left have moved miles further Left,4
15,I still consider myself a liberal person just in the govt should let me do what I want kind of way the womens rights and civil rights kind of way and protect the earth and our national parksnot the put on enough of a wokeformance that straight white cis males cry privileged tears way,4
16,Ah yes the tried and true Ronald Regan approach,3
17,I was an independent for about 10 years of my voting life My Political Views Havent Changed much either There were some things that I didnt agree with the Right like limited regulation of companies  as in some things republican didnt want to regulate what so ever separation church and state  Im atheist and I dont think school is a place to indoctrinate kids I was at the time Pro legalization of drugs  now that Ive seen what can happen  seattle Im not so much The left has become the party of radical feminism Its the party of blaming everyone else and using the stone man approach to problem solving The lefts mistakes has taught me complex problems usually require complex solutions that take a long time to get things fixed which is incompatible with there blame blaming everyone else approach,2
18,This is proof that Leftismprogressivism ruins everything it touches It destroyed the middle of the road democrat And those Dems are now speaking out against it Liberalism truly is a mental disorder,3
19,Funnily enough conservatives have shifted left socially in the last 20 years Most conservatives I know are fine with gay marriage and legalizing weed for example Conservatives are looking a lot more like classic libertarians these days,3
20,Whats the matter You dont like sexualizing 5 year olds And have the white ones apologize for their racism You Bigot S,3
0,That kid who tracks his plane on twitter is fucking sweating right now,329
1,I saw some 20 year old Twitter trader tell his followers to all buy 55 calls before the news Now they all think they are going to bankcant wait till they find out what happens to options above the buyout price,188
2,I hope he buys it and then just shuts the servers down forever,156
3,The most entertaining outcome is the most likelyElon backs out of the deal at the last second Price tanks to 30 on this news Earnings are reported and it tanks to 20 Elon makes new offer at 29B Saves 14B,150
4,Holy shit Didnt think this would happen but it did This timeline is insane,145
5,I literally bought like 20 517 20 puts a few hours ago hahaha,96
6,hahhahaha this is amazing and people will lap it upSo Elon putting down 3bn gets Apollo who are the specialists on LBOs to chip inSo theyll buy TWTR using its own assets for debt financing for a 54 price when Elon paid 33Theyll add an edit button and next year theyll IPO it for 70 or higher cash out like kingsThats the quickest 50 they have all ever madeWell done Elon using his CEOcelebrity status as collateral for banks since twitter got fuck all worthy assets,91
7,How pissed will Elon be if he finds out he can get the Twitter App for free on the AppStore,83
8,RIP Elon Private Jet guy  Snipers moving in as we speak,76
9,Im sure a free speech absolutist will have zero issues with Tesla employees attempting to unionize via a Twitter grass roots campaign,70
10,Ah fuck I think I kinda understand it The shares cost 5420 Options to sell shares at any other price lower are worthless because no one would sell less than 5420 OTM calls are worthless because the price is 5420 it will not go higher This is why all the oldheads say dont fuck with options if you dont get them I learned a valuable lesson today Im stupid,67
11,Why the FUCK does everything get halted over news OH SHIT SOMETHING EXCITING LETS STOP TRADING SO WE CAN PROTECT OUR ASSES,58
12,Just gonna leave this here  When a company is bought for a cash price per share the options will be valued for cash settlement on the date the buyout is effective A call option on the bought company will have value if the buyout price is above the option exercise or strike price As a example you hold an option to buy at 40 per share and the underlying stock is bought out for 50 cash On the date the buyout is effective you would receive 1000 for your option the 50 buyout price minus the 40 option strike price times the 100 shares that one option contract covers If the strike price on your call was above the 50 you would get nothing Put option holders would receive cash if the buyout price were below the put strike price A trader who sold options would be required to deliver the cash,59
13,44 billion I got twitter for free on the App Store,55
14,Trumps return is imminent,53
15,Buy PYPL back bro I have bags,51
16,Everybody who said this was a pump and dump Come get your paddlin,42
17,Can someone smarter than me explain to me why the price isnt hovering around 542 Doesnt this price mean that anyone who buys right right now around 52 can make an almost guaranteed 45 profit,42
18,What happens to all my options calls above 60,40
19,The salt The salty tears Its soo delicious,40
20,realDonaldTrump Im back,39

1,Yes there is so much diversity tolerance and inclusion in woke media Loads of it Practically overflowing s,180
2,Diversity equity and inclusion is just their way of repackaging Marxism  Equity is a trash doctrine  There is no system on earth that can force everyone to be equal,96
3,Whats hilarious to me is the employees of these companies will complain about racism sexism  or ideologies they dislike embedded in their company when the company is literally all democrats,45
4,This is what they mean by unity,36
5,I feel sooooooo included by Twatter Please Mr Musk dont make it change,17
6,WOW this is so crazy  Literally exactly what Twitter was practicing on the daily they are projecting on the newly acquired Twitter  Libs have ZERO awareness,7
7,But theyre Different rememberWhen the dems say diversity they dont really mean it,5
8,But when they find out a minority is a Republican its game oveeeeeer,3
9,Why was Twitter giving 13 to Mitt Romney,5
10,Wahhhhh Im not able to shout everyone down anymore,4
11,I will always say this Private business should not be allowed to buy politicians its no longer needed in todays politics It should be against the law that politicians get money for shit other than what theyre doing for their job for the people,6
12,Remember when many on the left laughed at Fox News Fair and Balance slogan The tech companies makes Fox News look like bipartisan in comparison,3
13,I have 3 acounts on twitter tied to my phone number  I have never spoken evil of anyone or in response as a comment to anyone on twitterIn my description i have these things MAGA WWG1WGA and christianall of my accounts are permanently suspendedi always thought that real bias and persecution didnt exist but its happening,3
14,still an awful lot of commies at tesla though,2
15,These bitches need a reality check,2
16,These people are shitting the bed because theyre all in for pushing their ideology under the guise of fairness and someone just came over bought all their toys told them to get bent and just started playing with them,2
17,Funny but Tesla isnt far behind at 95 dem donators,1
18,Could it be that the employees who donate Republican just do not disclose it,1
19,Diversity Inclusion Equity seems more accurate,1

15,Tell that asshole to pay his taxes,4
16,Redditor realizes that people dont like slave owners circa 2022,2
17,ELON was on Trumps Science Committee which was made of billionaires Who only interest was on how they could screw over the American People to make more money,2
18,I really dont get his fanboys He was born into wealth and bought Tesla They act like he is some genius innovator when he is just a rich kid who bought a company,2
19,I said some critical stuff about him over on rantiwork and I got downvoted into oblivion,1
20,Why dont you guys like Elon,-5
0,The system sucks that Musk won thisHe forced Tesla to bail out the money losing other business he owned and way way overpaid for itwith Tesla shareholder assetsNot a single market analyst  at the time thought the purchase price was remotely worth itAnd SolarCity still hasnt come out with the solar tilesyears later So even worse than it lookedHow did the lawsuit fail Maybe its just hard to prove the facts in a case like this,437
1,The reddit heel turn on musk is hilarious,106
2,This guy always loves being in the news,17
3,As if more money needed to be taken than what is already taken from before,19
4,Someone here should be nice and explain a bit more about this I hadnt heard of it before nor do I care enough to research itBut comments indicate that technically Musk reported in a way that it made shareholders vote in favour of the mergeracquisitionStill it means shareholders VOTED in favour Its technically on them to do due diligence on their vote If you trust Musk enough to vote in favour of what he wants to do then I dont see how you could necessarily punish MuskI see people claim this is a misappropriation of funds but that would only be true if say he used cash or created equity to buy the company against the majority of shareholders wishes etcSo whats the go Is it just the judge saying You bought his sales pitch deal with it In that case Im not sure people should be blaming the system or yada yada,19
5,Damn Elon Musk and his thumbs through roledexinvesting in solar energy companies,6
6,Hardly surprising at all Teslas solar business formerly Solarcity is making money Frankly it doesnt really matter if he did indeed bail out his brothers company if said acquisition is now generating value for shareholders You cant recover damages when there arent any everything else is pretty irrelevant No damages  failed lawsuit,3
7,Dude just needs to buy donald trump move to a private island and just feed each others egos with compliments away from everyone else Its what they so desperately and obviously crave,4
8,Hes gonna do the same with Twitter,3
9,Hey ElonYou dont have to have all the toys in the toybox,-1
10,Go to Meet Kevin YouTube video where he explains judges decision in depth,-1
11,This entire house of cards is balanced on the federal governments subsidization of electric cars purchases Once the true cost of a Tesla is fully realized sales will drop off and the money goes bye bye,-1
12,Every time Elon Wins OMGERD THERES NO JUSTICE IN THIS WORLDEvery time Elon Loses OMGERD THAT BASTARD DESERVED ITFFS people get a life,-2

1,He will find out why Twitter was run the way it was,92
2,Imagine if Twitter wasnt around Id be very willing to bet that if it wasnt the world would be better off These tech developers Twitter Facebook etc I think initially set out with good intentions in the beginning but completely underestimated the strength of it and the consequences it brings,53
3,For all the people saying Eu rules dont apply to American companies and eu cant enforce it   They can block Twitter if they wanted to And sure there are ways around it but the whole world doesnt have to play by American rulesthat being said Elon isnt stupid He may loosen the reigns a bit And make a fancy new show of it  But the base rules of Twitter wont be changed ,18
4,d,10
5,Easy way to fix this this tweet is banned in your country To view the tweet please connect to the internet from another country Here is a link to my VPN solution only 5 a month,12
6,Freedom of speech is a concept established and guaranteed by the law Letting everyone say whatever the heck they want on one specific private website is not exactly freedom of speech,15
7,I hope he shuts down service in EuropeOr just shut it down everywhereEither make it totally open for everyone to use or  it,7
8,Fuck twitter facebook instagram etc World would be a better place without all this totally unnecessary crap,10
9,Hopefully I can get one of my nine suspended Twitter accounts back then,6
10,Elon musk says he wants freedom of speech and people think that alone is a bad thing Man,2
11,Dont mess with our propaganda machine or else,4
12,Oh so now its an issue ,4
13,Yall know we can all defund this by deleting our accounts right,3
14,Best outcome would be to just make the whole of twitter open source and take down twitter itself just set the servers on fire and be done with it,2
15,Breaking news Elon buys the EU,1
16,I sincerely hope people  Twitter This billionaire is bored with making money Now he wants power And power shouldnt be bought It should be earned,1
17,Wouldnt mind twitter disappearing from Europe the less American influence the better,1
18,So far most of the people rejoicing about free speech have been the ones making hateful comments dangerous misinformation and straight up threats If any speech is free speech Twitters about to become way worse than 4chan,1
19,I think what worries most people is that Elon doesnt know the line between free speech and propaganda While free speech is the bedrock of democracy propaganda is the bedrock of fascism,1
20,Oh no What are we gonna do,1
0,What are these comments People think its a good thing that the richest person in history whos known for silencing critics is buying one of the worlds most used social media platforms,345
1,What happens if some people dont want to sell their shares Can they be forced,211
2,Its disappointing seeing that so many people in an investment sub of all places think this has anything to do with free speech He is still selling the saving humanity act with the kind of money that could have actually saved alot of humanity Oh well we will just have to wait and see if speech really is free under Elons control,117
3,I love how people here are trying to say the left wants to silence free speech as if theyre not just wanting to silence racism sexism misogyny bigotry and hate in generalFree speech isnt a free hate pass Yall really looking for an excuse to be an asshole,94
4,serious question  its currently 5190 Why not buy a shit ton now since payout will be 5420,88
5,Stupidest purchase of all time,67
6,This is more about politics than free speech Now Donald has his platform back for the next election The pendulum has swung completely in the other direction,47
7,Musk dick riders are gonna be insufferable,41
8,I guess theyre bringing back wwwTrumpthoughtsgovwwwtrumpthoughts,10
9,Itll be interesting to see if he goes full freedom of speech with it and how legislators heads will explode if he does,9
10,Woke people must be shitting bricks right nowEdit there they come lmao Downvote all you want I couldnt care less lmao,9
11,Time to sell my TSLA stocks,10
12,Time to uninstall Twitter,10
13,Does this make any call options above 5420 worthless,8
14,Very good Now a child who cant take any criticism and is a pump and dump artist controls an app that allows free speech Seems like a great combination,9
15,An ultrawealthy manchild in control of an influential media outlet Just what the world needs right now,8
16,How much TSLA is he going to have to sell to cover I read he has raised 20B in loans  is he finding partners for the other 20B,8
17,If anyone wonders whether Reddit leans left or right just check out these comments and see where the upvotes are  Wtf happened to talking about investing  Canadian investment landscape not interesting enough,7
18,Im still not convinced Elons serious yet Still lots of legal mumbo jumbo to hash out yet before something like this is finalized,7
19,Billionaires want to control the narrative  Rupert Murdock Jeff Bezo Warren Buffet Elon now all control media companies,7
20,Elon is prodisinformation so expect that to reach ever more dizzying heights,6
0,Wealthy people buy a pro sports team If you are the most wealthy it seems logical you would try to buy the public square,703
1,reddit about to lose its mind,289
2,I dont care that much if this deal goes through but its amusing that people think hes going to make Twitter a bastion of free speech Letting people say what they want typically isnt good business and Tesla having NDAs shows that he realizes thisEdit Im not saying that NDAToS The point is that they both involve limiting speech,199
3,Let the salt mines overflow,103
4,Paid 43 billion just to be able to snoop on Chelsea and Grimes DMs,97
5,Any reason not to load up at 50 and take the boost to 5420 if this comes through,55
6,So what happens to shareholders if this deal goes through Get bought out guaranteed at the 5420 price point,50
7,Its amusing how upset people are by this Oh youre mad that a billionaire will be running twitter Dont you know that its already run by billionaires,48
8,The amount of top comments convinced that this was just a pump and dump scheme on various subreddits has been hilarious Now we move on to the 5000 people posting LOL MUSK IS GOING TO SAY HE FOUNDED TWITTER comments,32
9,I would love if he buys and people stop using it Never going to happen like that but it would have been the best,25
10,Unless Elon has some sort of brilliant plan for monetizing the company which he very well may I cant figure out why he cares so much Twitters business is so bad that it was worth more as a private company than a public oneIs Elon buying this crap company with no clear financial upside simply because hes a bored billionaire whose ego wont let him stopWith the market down right now there are SO many other better companies to put money into,19
11,Time for Twitter board to learn to code Elon is known to fire underperforming,14
12,This is worse than stocktwits,11
13,Committed financing changes nothing Nobody ever doubted that Musk could afford to payThe offer is still a significant lowball Make him pay more,12
14,I can foresee a mass resignation and walkout if this deal closes Could really be a disaster for Musk,8
15,What stops anyone from buying Twitter right now at 51 knowing that they will get 54 for each share as soon as the deal closesSeems like free money Am I missing something,5
16,Elon Musk has stated he wants all humans on Twitter to be verified with blue check and not just woke celebrities so that bots trying to create division are easily identified and banned This is a danger to democracy Also Elon Musk I hope that even my worst enemies stay on Twitter because that is what free speech meansWoah this man has to be stopped,4
17,His public opinion arc is really going full circle on redditFor some reason people hate him for buying twitter,4
18,Ill take Elon owning Twitter over the Saudis any day ,2
19,So if I own Twitter shares am I forced to sell them to elon just because he wants to buy them  Is he allowed to just tell me what he feels like paying or can I set a price based on what I think a share is worth,2
20,Hope he streams firing the board it would cap what has been a really entertaining ride Wouldnt need to stream the meltdown among employees they will do that themselves,2
0,Its funny I keep hearing that but the only bad experiences Ive had have been unprovoked from idiot convoy supporters Ive been working with the same manual therapist for five years for rehabilitation and strength training and he saw a relatively innocuous photo on my Facebook feed the picture of the Canadian womens hockey team wearing N 95s and kicking Russias ass I made a snarky comment about the whiny truckers He completely lost his shit with me said I was supporting the government that was subjugating his family Now the real irony here is this guy is from fucking Cuba  The second one was my tenant he was trying to back me into a corner to have a conversation about this he drank the ivermectin KoolAid and I told him flat out I didnt wanna discuss it with him because I did not want it to impact our friendly relationship Well he kept pushing and pushing and I lost my shit on him which is something I rarely do Im not going to evict him because Im not a dick But thats my experience   I have zero interest in other peoples politics as long as they dont directly impact me I dont talk about abortion I dont talk about hot political hot issues with the people in my life because I have no interest in trying to convince somebody to believe the same stuff I do Im not a Christian ,21

2,oh fuck off Felicity your ten year old did not say that,31

6,When I was 15 I was on My Chemical Romance stan twitterno child should be exposed to the hellhole that is Twitter,10
7,He is 100 not unshackling people,6
8,Because if his employees use Twitter as  means to organize unions Im sure hell be totally fine with it Right,5
9,Little shit isnt even allowed to have Twitter lmao,6
10,Elon doesnt own Twitter yet and he has already broken agreements in the contract he made with the Twitter board in the stipulations of buying it,3

0,No it cannotMost developing nations have ineffective supply chains and rampant corruptionSolving those two would have a better impact than monetary donations,1860
1,It wouldnt For example the problem in Yemen is that Saudi Arabia wants the Yemeni people to starve They are using their military to ensure this happens They block food aid and they attack means of production to produce food In order to save the starving Yemeni people you need to go to war with Saudi Arabia and then win and then use the money to feed everyone which isnt going to happen The famine in Yemen is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world right now and its the easiest to explain Try North Korea Kim Jung Un doesnt want his people to have food because then they might rebel if they had enough food to think properly Therefore even if we gave them food aid it wouldnt reach the people who need it In order to feed the North Koreans wed have to invade North Korea and take control over the country and then feed the people there,408
2,The simple answer is Supply Chain solutionsWe dump a lot of food that never even makes it off the shelf to rot,295
3,Im sure this will get downvoted  Nobody ever talks about it but Musk donated 57 billion dollars to charities after the UN food program told him that is how much it would cost to end world hunger    They sent him a plan and Musk donated money accordingly Of course they changed their tune when it was pointed out that they themselves raised over 9 billion in one year and failed to stop world hunger The UN now say Musk saved 42 million from starvation,237
4,It doesnt lol,165
5,World hunger and poverty are systemic problems Its not something easy as dumping money into it and it solves itself Poor countries tend to be very corrupt and undemocratic The only long term solution is to promote economic development and money can help with that if its managed properly,101
6,The UNs plan was to end hunger for a year End of the year theyre back to square one again Cant blame Elon for seeing through that one,71
7,Pretty sure those are the same people who would say that there are 300 million people in the United states so for only 300 million dollars everyone could have a million dollars  Also pretty sure Bill Gates has donated that much for addressing hunger at this point and yetstill have World hunger not saying Bill wastes his time doing that that is awesome,45
8,It wouldnt work because throwing money at other countries and expected them to actually use it for its intended purpose would not work,35
9,Its usually people that dont understand net worth that post things like that Billionaires dont have that much cash on hand They do have a lot of buying power You cant borrow money if the borrower doesnt think that money will make you money,33
10,I mean even if you buy the whole world a 66 billion dollar meal theyre just gonna get hungry again 6 hours later,19
11,dude if elon decides to try to end world hunger ppl would still try to find a way to say hes bad,21
12,The problem isnt about the lack of money its about the assholes in charge who wont use it for the right purpose,14
13,Ending world hunger would mean eradicating world corporate greed Impossible for the current state of humanity,6
14,It doesnt Its a publicity stunt from a business man turned cult leader Nothing more,8
15,If you give a man a fish you feed him for a day If you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime,7
16,Only thing that will end world hunger is making some countries self sufficient and not rely on handouts forever,7
17,66  Billion worth of twinkies are air dropped onto the starving people Or the money could be used to relocate them to land they can grow food on and for farming equipment Give the people the means of production something something Or teach them how to fish instead of giving them fish as they say But more variety,5
18,It cant thats the problem Sure the man could certainly be putting his money to good work in the world and is deciding actively not to The bs about 6bn could solve world hunger Is a comical farce,4
19,It doesnt Elon Musk doesnt have even approximately the resources to end hunger even if he had the inclination This is just one more of the bullshit claims he craps out on a regular basisTo solve this problem youd need to fix pretty much all of human society,6
20,If 66B could end world hunger a nation woudl have already done it 44b could end world hunger a nation would have already done it These arguements are empty pointless and compacted out of spite for elon based off misinformation campaigns The US alone spends trillions on pointless projects that are supposed to create healthy advancement progresses at home and around the world and fail to do so more often than not It has never been simple Fact of the matter is life is a bitch Literally speaking there has to be a bottom floor for there to be a top There has to be poor people for there to be rich Same with middle class If everyone was considered equal it would create chaos Cause certain people desire more from life those who work the hardest expect the most Equality is impossible even if you made it plain and simple it just wont work history has proven that over and over and over again Nothing will end world hunger we can make it better but we will never end it,5
0,This was reported many times and automod  this It has been approved Sorry for the take down,1
1,I agree with Reddit on 90 of things  yikes,676
2,I agree with Reddit on 90 of thingsOh you sweet summer childwhy is Elon chosen to be the one that is hated onBecause hes the only billionaire openly engaged in the culture war and on the side opposite of lefties Hes not a Republican by any stretch but hes very successful businessman  open minded accepting of beliefs he disagrees with staunchly profreedom basically everything the left hates,369
3,Because there is a concerted media effort to weaken muskThis always happens when someone or something threatens the status quo of powerElon threatens the current model of companies being founded by people who never went to business school taken over by MBAs who strip and gut it until it dies all while making wallstreet mediocre market gains the whole way to bankruptcyImagine if someone disrupts the path to money and success also power and control by making the most lucrative and powerful corporations obsoleteElon threatens the power of big oil and big industry Image a world where a few companies dont have exclusive ownership of energy supply to the world A limited resource that most people have no tangible access to versus renewable energy a source anyone with a small amount of investible capital can afford distributing a concentrated model to a more democratic distributed modelThe same thing happens with Fox news obsession with AoC who made no difference in Congress numbers by replacing an entrenched democratic candidate What AoC threatened is the means by which Fox news expects candidates for Republican party to go through them for air time and endorsement Something AoC had far less of on the left than other candidates and theoretically future Republicans can do what AoC did to established Republicans and if that happens fox news will lose a tremendous amount of power to determine who the Republican candidates will bePeople in power are afraid that the success of people who democratized a process will reduce the power of the entrenched wealth and power of the world because it absolutely willThat doesnt mean that people who do this effectively wont have a giant target painted on their backsAny liberal who thinks Elon owning Twitter is bad for America is grossly uninformedThen again most people are grossly uninformed exactly the way the media wants people to be Imagine living in a world where the weather channel is the most trusted news source There is nothing wrong with having a standpoint when you cover stories in the news but in order for it to not be misleading propaganda the opinion needs to be informed and most media pieces have either no facts or cherry picked facts to tell a misleading narrative in order to generate the most outrage and the highest ad revenue,343
4,Envy Fear Blindness to the paradigm shift hes creating A privatized twitter Ignorance of the socalled corporate bailouts given to Boeing Northrop GE Martin etc He sends crews and supplies to the ISS for a pittance yet hes accused of taking on welfare He hasnt been accused of altruism but what do I know,345
5,Reddit is a tiny place among the world,59
6,His African,52
7,Because its a leftist echo chamber lol now theyll have to seethe,54
8,Hes the fucking manyoure just seeing a bunch of lefties freaking out because some other dipshit leftie told them to,48
9,Theres a couple things you have to realise before it makes sense why its this way Most people dont actually watch interviews and listen to Musk speak Huge percentage have never even heard him talk beforeWhat they have heard is whats on in the news and what they see within their friends groups on social media and so they build up an image about him simply based on thatYou cannot change that in people  they need to want to seek the desire to listen and understand what hes doing So youll find it extremely difficult to go and have a conversation with somebody that already has their mind set The best you can do is every now and then find a comment that stands out to you that you have a bit of knowledge on and just educate them on that one specific topicIf you can open somebodys eyes and mind for just a moment there will be a slow shift over time But for right now people are struggling to make ends meet and costs are forever going up they need someone or something to get angry at and unfortunately the worlds wealthiest person is a prime target,44
10,Tall poppy syndrome and hes outspoken and loves the limelight which will always invite disdainI reckon Green Goblin said it best Well to each his own I chose my path you chose the way of the hero And they found you amusing for a while the people of this city But the one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail fall die trying In spite of everything youve done for them eventually they will hate you Why bother,40
11,I love Elon Im an investor in his companies and Twitter I want only the best for his efforts in expanding humanityHowever I would have preferred he not buy Twitter It is a big distraction and if he messes up it will only give FB more power  Twitter does need to be improved but I personally dont think he is the one to do it RegardlessElon is the man,32
12,Hes super rich and most redditors are socialists,26
13,They hate rich people But they especially hate vocal ones that give their opinion,25
14,Its because most of the people on Twitter like it there They like their echo chamber and feel that anyone with a different opinion should be blacklisted The kind that like to doxx people and weaponise posts from 10 years agoA bunch of people are hating it because Hell probably reinstate Donald Trumps account Theyre hating Elon because of something he MIGHT do Theyre scared of changeIf you support free speech then you got to be the kinder person and let them say they hate him We need to learn that people will always have different opinions especially with a global audience as wide as the internet,21
15,One billionaire is making all of the other billionaires mad so what does that tell you,19
16,The biggest reason is probably because both sides hate him He supports policies on both sides of the political spectrum an obvious example being that he supports UBI while also being an industrialist This makes him prime target for both sidesThe left hates him because hes a rich industrialist who expects his workers to dedicate their entire lives to their jobs and the right wing hates him because he believes in climate change and poses a big threat to traditional automotive and energy companiesIt doesnt help that Musk is perfectly fine with currying favors with less than savory characters if it means he gets to complete his goals And that his own character isnt the greatest ie his own response to Covid and calling that one dude a pedo for no reasonSo after the novelty of Tesla and a rich person that believes in UBI wore off it isnt exactly surprising that reddit a very left leaning group will start turning on him,17
17,Because the Main Stream Media has news control and been brainwashing people for quite some time  Get off the alphabet ABCCBSGOOGLENBCMSNBCetcetc and do your own research unless you want Big Brother to tell you what to think,14
18,Elon probably coming for reddit next The heads exploding would be epic,15
19,If you agree with Reddit on 90 of things Id recommend lowering that to around 0,11
20,Mainstream reddit is teenagers with far left bernie opinions Bernie doesnt like elon and vice versa So they hate elon Even though he has done more for climate change than everyone on left combined,12
0,How much yall wanna bet that free speech absolutist Musk is gonna try to bury all negative news about Teslapositive news about competitors EVs,282
1,And private companies should be free to do what their board members want to do,159
2,I love how people think hes going to unban every account including Trumps Theres still a ton of people working below him and bringing Trump back would be a shitstorm of advertisers pulling out Theres a reason these other right wing free speech platforms fold in a few months Fundamentally nothing will change on twitter,84
3,Cool just another dayrich people being rich people,73
4,I dont think people realise but you can have free speech and limits on harassment These are two distinct things I think hes been more concerned about how people have been shut down due to misinformation which is a loosely defined term with too many caveats I personally see this as a win for society There isnt a popular platform that allows free and open conversations and dialogue as theyve been too concerned about their shareholders as opposed to the beginning overarching future of open dialogue This should allow an open platform to all but can still have limits and moderation for harassment such as death threats for example As much as I disagree with Trump politically I didnt like that he was  from Twitter and YouTube even recently due to misinformation Because who decided what is misinformation For example some political stances or scientific discoveries can take time to be determined to be true and in the meantime could be seen as misinformation Yes there can be harm caused by false statements but taking those voices away instead of countering arguments with dialogue is way more of a slippery slope I understand private businesses can act how they like and protected speech in America only applied to government and not businesses but social media has become essential the way in which thoughts and expressions are now shared and this is dangerous to moderate other than as mentioned for examples of harassment Although the terms on harassment etc will need to be defined at least without having to worry about shareholders then they can concentrate on these issues without any politics involved Or at least this is my hope I may be proven wrong,51
5,If it goes through the private company can do whatever it wants and wont be beholden to shareholders Ultimately this will probably be a good thing for Twitter and free speech in general As a side note I wouldnt be surprised if Vine gets relaunched after the Twitter purchase It probably wouldnt be too hard to find a way to monetize things and make Twitter financially stable,41
6,Im pro privatization in many if not most cases but Im getting really tired of fucking  billionaires buying up all the media platforms so they can use them as their mouthpiece,34
7,Cant wait for Now Twitter is shit Its been shit since near the beginning  Hell the idea that  anyone can get a voice on the platform Ignores that a majority of interactions with tweets come from a small group of accounts almost all are major brands and celebrities   Yes theres a few new faces in there pseudo celebrities or new wave of celebrities from Youtube or twitch but the fact is its still a HEAVILY consolidated platform that is focused only on the uber popularNot to mention the fucking horrible trending tab that just pushes bullshit stories at you trying to make you care about shit that DOESNT FUCKING MATTER  And yeah thats what social media is but man imagine if it could be better,33
8,Its a done deal twitter stocks halted as it goes private,28
9,Andddd sold  wsjcomlivecoveragetwitterelonmusklatestnews,21
10,Isnt allowing Twitter to run their platform as they see fit a fundamental libertarian value If Twitter doesnt want to sell then that is their peragative right Let competition and the market price them out correctIm trying to determine if you are looking at this from a libertarian aspect or from a personal aspect,19
11,lol  everyone in this thread who thinks elon musk is a free speech champion,13
12,d,9
13,a lot of right leaning folks are ecstatic about this thinking this is owning the libs and bringing back real true free speech and all that  And theyre mischaracterizing the lefts reaction as authoritarian I think theres some of that for sure wanting to make sure that Trump et al stay banned but theres more at play and at stake here  I dont use Twitter Reddit is really the only social media I use so I dont really care what happens to them as a platform or a business  But I think theres a real conversation to have here Removing any moderation ability from a platform like this doesnt protect just the free speech of a regular person from Omaha or Lisbon it opens the whole thing up to coordinated psyops from Russia China Iran Saudi Arabia USA et al the exact OPPOSITE of what would protect Democracy Look at whats happened to Facebook since like 2014  It basically solely exists now as a propaganda machine    This is where I struggle with my Libertarianism I want to buy fully into it but were in a world now  where the tools to undermine our cultures and society are so strong that taking a laissez faire attitude to it all is just as dangerous Were in a place where the threat of authoritarianism in government and Corporatocracy are about at parity    A rampant unchecked company can do as much or more harm than an unchecked government and I dont know what a middle ground looks like  But its probably not having all the media owned by billionaires,8
14,Oh god Just what we need another egotistical blowhard owning a social media platform,7
15,Good for the shareholders   I hope to see the shareholders gain bigtime employees who can will take golden parachutes and the value of the company overall go to shit If this ends with musk having to sell his position in Tesla it would be superduperhilarious   ImExited to make my first Twitter account so I can gleefully test his free speech absolutism by poking fun at him daily,8
16,I trust Musk more than the elites running it now,8
17,Libertarians that simp for oligarchs are the most embarrassing of cuckolds,6
18,Im guessing conservatives dont want to repeal Section 230 anymore,4
19,Despite the fact Elon isnt a huge fan of free speech within his own company despite the fact every free speech website ends up implementing regulations because people cant and wint control themselves despite the fact this is another move of money and media control being controlled by a now smaller subset of peopleThis will be a good move,6
20,What about this has to do with Libertarianism,4

1,Aah the true endgame Of course,29
2,Now do one where biden didnt invite elon to an electric car manufacturer meeting at the white house so elon bought twitter and released the trump,17
3,Hey now All about that free speech,13
4,Imagine being so dumb that you think that Elon Musk would pay 45 billion dollars to stop a worthless bot from providing the public with already public information I cant imagine how hard it must be for some of you to get dressed in the morning,10
5,Fine Ill do it myself,9
6,If that kid starts posting on Facebook Elon will have to buy that too,8

0,How many times do we need to tell people that all billionaires are terrible people inherently You dont get to that amount of wealth by being nice and ethicalPeople are still going to suck his dick and laugh at his corny edge lord teenager jokes so what can you do,156
1,Elon Musk doesnt mind bringing back indentured servitude to colonize Mars,49
2,Im not a Musketeer but the apartheid emerald thing is completely false Hate him for a whole bunch of legitimate reasons but this aint one of themhttpssavingjournalismsubstackcompitalkedtoelonmuskaboutjournalism,27
3,What a pos,12
4,I think we know this,4
5,I just cant support someone having billions and billions of dollars up in the hundreds while so many people are stuck starving and broke No matter how good they might be He might not be some snidelywhiplashmustachioed monster but theres just no reason to have that money and spend it on launching your car into spaceAnd Im not going to listen to anyone saying oh well thats just business and capitalism or hes just smart blah blah blah Thats got nothing to do with this having that much money just isnt right,4
6,Elon Musks father once said he owned half a emerald mine in Zambia where does this apartheid spin come from,4
7,Is his wealth from South Africa I thought it came from the creation and sell of Pay PalHe is a horrible person but I didnt think he had generational wealth from South Africa,4
8,i mean its still his money,1
9,Wait until you realize how much he could give you and the whole nation and still have an extraordinary amount of money ,1
10,,-2
11,How much of the USs wealth what does that even mean in this context came from slavery and other race based privilege and how much of it came from pure capitalist exploitation where race wasnt a factorAlso Elon Musk donated billions to some charity after this tweethttpsfortunecom20220215elonmusk57billiondonationweeksafteraskingunworldhungertextThen2C20on20Nov20152Con20the20brink20of20famineE2809D The fact that it wasnt a food bank however makes me think that it had nothing to do with stopping people from going hungry and Im not really willing to give someone like Musk the benefit of the doubt,-12

8,AwesomenessgifgiphyIp5D1pwQ4pKs8,3
9,My dad tonight when I brought it up well Elons going to finally kick him off the platform Me incredulous what Do you mean hes been off and heard Elon will reinstate him I havent heard anything yet no no Trumps been on Twitter for years Oh yeah Hes been on in secret doing some makes keyboard typing gesture behind the scenes what are you even talking about,1

1,Never in a million years Well burn this place down before we hand it over     Waithow much money,83
2,I guess Twitters Q1 earnings arent going to be good,41
3,Trump about to get his Twitter account back,17
4,repost from an hour ago,13
5,Musk is a pretty toxic person to buy the company There is long term damage to the brand to consider,10
6,His offer is 15x what they wanted Simple math If he has already bought 9 at 28B then the whole company was valued at around 311B He offered almost 15x of that Im sure my simple math is too straight forward for the rich and shady businessmen maybe thats now how he bought the 9,5
7,Every message boardwebsite Ive been on that got bought out by someone way too interested in it has gone to shit This wont be any different,4
8,Nobody cares about Musks business dealings This is not a stocks sub,-1
9,I wish Twitter would cease to exist It gives absolute monkey brain ashtrays a platform to spread their low intellect,3
10,While Elon might be sincere in buying Twitter it does raise some flags to me1 It doesnt have any clear strategic synergy with his businesses Tesla Boring Company Solar City now Tesla Energy  SpaceX You can at least see how these are interrelated in their mission statements A consumer social network which is really an advertising platform is a whole other animal and with Elon as handson as he is I dont think hell be able to learn how to run it well without the other businesses suffering unless he plans to appoint folks to run them for him doubtful Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post but he also stepped down from being CEO of Amazon and is not the CEO of the Post either Do you see Elon doing anything similar here 2 When he was interviewed on the subject of content moderation  the social platform business insiders came away with the notion that he doesnt have a firm grasp of the business He already has shown in the past that he doesnt always know what hes talking about and likes to dismiss Subject Matter Experts This happened with him hyping Bitcoin and then dropping payment for Teslas with it due to environmental concerns like it wasnt common knowledge that Bitcoin mining was problematic in the 1st place We then have his Covid prediction statements despite what the vast majority of Public Health experts were saying at the time This feels like a repeat here as folks who know the business like the Ex Reddit CEO are publicly saying he doesnt know what hes in for and hes blowing their warnings  suggestions off I wont be surprised if Twitter tells him to pound sand  he either keeps his stock as is or sells it off at a later date Either way he got a ton of press,3
11,money talks,2
12,Reddit should be nextAll those frustrated mods banning people left it right would have to find another hobby,2
13,As usual money buys anything even that so called dignity from TwitterAnd people wants to know why social media and informatics are so fucked up this days haha,1
14,They have a legalfiduciary obligation to look and consider but Id be surprised if they went through with it,1
15,I mean given its significance its probably the only thing theyre looking at right now Im sure there are multiple daily checkins just on this,1
16,Well no one sells out to the first quoted price,1
17,Whether youre touched by Biden or suck Trumps Trombone you gotta admit its nice to just sit back and watch the everyone meltdown over Elon musk and Twitter So glad I dont have a political dog in any fight Because thats what this is really about Its not about free speech Tesla has horrible working terms and conditions and suppresses news stories about their batteries exploding And anyone that disagrees with mainstream USA loves Trump theyd suck Trump off quicker than their brother husband cousin Pardon me while I watch the world burn,-1
18,Im still under the suspicion this entire thing is a stunt to buy their stock encourage HODLers to increase the value of the stock then sell it all before anyone realizes it making a huge profit in a mere few weeks,1
19,Anybody surprised by this Like at all,1
20,I have never understood the appeal of twitter,1
0,Doesnt Elon not really believe in Web3,8
1,Web3 is the future and Elons acquisition of Twitter is a direct ticket that twitter will join Web3,5
2,TWTR had a 45bi with ad revenue in 2021 check balance sheet against 115B of Meta and believe me 210B from Google Its a gold mine They are already incorporating Web3 into their applications and this trend is growing fast among many crypto projects The latest Polkadots parachain winners Equilibrium Unique Phala are closely related to Web3 Metaverse AI and ML develops follow the same way In addition to that the number of devs is growing exponentially,2
3,Twitter already has NFT pfps wtf you all talking about,1
4,Interesting idea How expensive are those transfers and which cryptos are available there for sending My favorite stablecoins from the Emoney project EEUR ECHF ENOK are instant settlement coins with nearzero transaction fees,1
5,There are areas of Web3 that have amazing applications that could be revolutionary or destructive as well this is one of the destructive ones its an online return to the gold standard if used for spending as a fiat If not then its whatever and a cool new feature,1
6,Elon is building a mafia and I dont know if such power in one mans hands is safe Props for chainge finance tho great feature and right timing Thanks for sharing,1
7,Having Twitter on web3 I wonder what it would mean for the social media app i think there are more pressing issues like how to authenticate accounts something which can be solved by Alliance Block Trustless Identity Verification product,1
8,Yay make something terrible even worse The joys of this century,1
9,To be clear this post is not so much about web3 or Twitter as promoting this chainge product,1
10,I couldnt believe my eyes when I read the update about twitters sale I honestly thought Twitter would hold their own on such a deal Elon now becomes the face of next gen legacy,0
11,Guys I am looking for some projects to invest could you recommend me something interesting,-4
12,Yah Im leaving twitter Reddits gonna be my home now,-4

0,Snapshot of Private Eye Elon Musk Twitters Largest Shareholder An archived version can be found herehttpsarchiveisrun1url privateeyecoukpicturescaptionselontwitterjpg      I am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorukpolitics if you have any questions or concerns,1
1,thing that gets me is having all that money and still bothering with Twitter Like you could be on a super yacht off the amalfi coast but instead youre buying Twitter because youre convinced youve been shadowbanned from the timelines of everyone except fellow megavirgins,190
2,So when is he buying Reddit,33
3,Musk buys Twitter to allow himself to pump and dump crypto scams without getting banned CMV,21
4,The whole reaction to this is honestly fascinatingFirst of all Last election Elon musk endorsed Andrew yang A democrat He has never endorsed trump He shits on Bernie Sanders a lot Make of that what you will But people acting out like hes a trump mega fan is hilarious People say mainstream media influence is dying when in reality it picks what people careget angry about stillCan I ask this to all you guys here Why do you think there was none of the media outrage and no posts here when Jeff Bezosamazon bought Twitch or Alexa or the Washington postor Imdb I could literally go on and on and on Its all about power greasing the right palms Something Jeff bezos clearly does and elon dosntHow about you guys look intocare about Saudi Arabias control of twitter How the chairman of Kingdom KHC Alwaleed Talal was tortured by the saudi arabian government and basically ceased all control of what he had to the goverment including his massive stake in twitterHell just search saudi arabia and twitter scandals why do you think powerful people the media are freaking out about elon musk owning twitter Why do you think youre being made to care so much about this acquisition and not others,15
5,Donald Trumps Twitter is coming back and hell use it to win AMERICA VOTES 2024 or whatever the media will call it next time,11
6,Hey hey we might be petulant and thin skinned narcissists but uh what was that third thing you said,10
7,Couldnt be less arsed personally Twitter is a shit show People act like Twitter hasnt given a platform for people like Trump for years and still do for other leaders and countries like RussiaHe cant make it any worse The hysteria coming from the user base mainly the Americans is insane Im pretty sure Musk supported the Democrats in the last elections if youre arsed about that although I dont know why you would be,6
8,Just curious about the original post picture do people consider Elon a narcissistic person then,5
9,UK politics Bit off topic regardless of the publication,3
10,Isnt he becoming the only shareholderie hes going to own 100 of the company himself,2
11,I feel that theyre channelling Mrs Merton here,1
12,I assumed he bought it so he could remove that guy who is tracking his plane,1
13,Do you like the idea of a narcissistic new money billionaire buying out the propaganda vehicle of organized old money Vanguard Blackrock Morgan StanleyNot sure what new censorship Elon can impose on an extremely censored platform Things that work against us algorithm hordes of brainwashed Westerners blue checks bots Xaffiliated state media all other existing censorship protocols However he can bring back Trump lol,1
14,I mean he wants to open source the twitter algo which is a world of goodSource  youtubecomwatchvcdZZpaB2kDM youtubecomwatchvcdZZpaB2kDM 1301At his recent Ted talk ,-1
15,Hes bought Reddit too,-3
16,Oh god now the Twitter mods will have to tolerate gasp free speech This is unacceptable CANCEL HIM,-2
17,Joke all you want I find it extremely worrying,-5
18,Are they implying Musk is also petulant and thinskinned Im not sure thats right theyre not good traits to have in a successful conman,-5
19,Musk is an American oligarch stealing money from the state and pretending hes a business guru So poor he cant pay taxes and relies on government assistance but so rich he can buy twitter outright,-6
20,Awesome I think thats great and expect to see the cesspit of Twitter sorted out now Looking forward to the open source algorithms so we can analyse and possibly stop the hatecults that have formed across society globally empowered by Twitter  its so unhealthy the culture that has formed out of Twitter just hatemobs everywhere on the platformJust to have a tinfoil moment though Mans got the metadata for his neurolink you think thats air your breathingEdit Also crypto adoption ,-6
0,Things will absolutely without a doubt change Twitter is a stagnant company and essentially has been since its inception The reputation is that their engineers basically sit around and do nothing The stock price has done pretty much fuck all since it went public almost a decade ago Theres been zero innovation Their ad tech is really bad given how long the company has been around They still have a ridiculously bad bot problem and its kinda astounding that they havent developed a better solution to keep it in check In short Twitter has been a mismanaged company Conversely Elons companies are run like sweat shops WLB is bad and Elon is constantly overpromising and then working his employees like cattle to try to get them to deliver I expect much of the company will be gutted and the daytoday working conditions for people that stick around will absolutely change,1002
1,I took a recruiter call from the Boring company and they wanted me to take a 60 paycut and work twice the hoursHard pass,431
2,Working conditions would change drasticallyFor one half of the compensation would be locked up as paper money This would be a much bigger deal,311
3,As someone who worked at Tesla anyone who works at any company ran by him has an extremely high chance of being severely disappointed and worked to death The work is built to such a point that any and all human functions are regulated to assembly line procedures in order to meet the high publicized demand as he is a numbers man and is focused on results first with little regard for casualties sustained and a burnt out workforce Not to mention the mental health factor and the pay The pay can be godawful And being driven to the point of daily mental breakdowns panic attacks and tumultuous depression Just my opinion But chances are it wont fare many changes for the better as opposed to what it is now and what will be expected as usual,265
4,,203
5,Lol do all Elon companies still have Must be willing to work overtime and weekends on their applications I mean that alone should tell you,160
6,The company is probably headed downhill in a big way Theres a reason he went for ownership instead of being on the board That reason is fiduciary responsibility If he went against that responsibility while he was on the board he could have been held legally liable He wants to do a bunch of stuff that will most likely damage the company for the sake of his ideology and ego and doesnt want the liability Also everything he directly works on ends poorly His management of Teslas autonomous vehicle program has been a disaster his micromanagement  is notorious at this point and even most of his early work at PayPal and other companies was so bad they redid it after he left He has spent a ton of time money and effort rewriting his history Twitter will be no exception,69
7,i mean musks companies tend to be or at least try to be on the cutting edge of an industry EV rockets etc twitter isnt the cutting edge of anything,74
8,based on what Ive heard from current and farmer tesla employees I would brush up my resume if he takes control That is if he doesnt fire you first,72
9,I wouldnt trust working for any company owned by MuskI work in aerospace Im more aware of the shit going on at SpaceX more than most at a minimum Going to take a hard pass on any CEO that thinks overworking their employees to the point of breaking is at all a good way to do business,53
10,A lot of big RSUs are going to be paid out which means a lot of golden handcuffs are coming off Therell be a small exodus before the ink dries,53
11,I might be in a good position to answer this  I know multiple people that have worked and interned for different engineering orgs within Tesla across Sunnyvale Palo Alto and Fremont  Although it varies by team about half the teams seem to have surges of overtime work  Elons lack of discipline runs throughout the company so priorities can shift quickly and sometimes by tweet  Some teams are very close to him which is a lot of pressure to keep up with his whims  Retention is also poor  In the midst of all this is a lot of cool technical innovation that is both driven by Elons desires while also being hindered by his roaming attention and lack of discipline  A friend who interned at SpaceX had similar things to say but fortunately had farther distance from Elon This all matched with my impressions when I interviewed for a software position at Tesla last year  I also talked with a senior dev at Twitter and did an interview last year  Contrary to what other people are saying in the thread Twitter has great engineering and employees  You can check out their technical blogs to see what I mean but to summarize their operations at scale highvolume data pipelines consistency across sharding focus on minimizing latency and high uptime numbers are very impressive  They seem dedicated to making their core services work great and had a clear vision about becoming a stable business supported by consistent revenue streams such as advertising  Sorry if this all sounds a bit buzzwordy  Their innovation is being a quietly good social network that avoids Facebooks PR disasters and Zuck weirdness keeps working all the time and is fast enough to stay on the pulse of everything  I got a very positive impression of Twitter and believe that it will change a lot with Elon at the helm  I think Twitter will follow his other companies and have both higher highs and lower lows  I assume most Twitter employees will hop off that roller coaster at some point as churn sets in,51
12,I have no stake in Twitter whatsoever including potential changes to working conditions I just want to say fuck Elon Musk,40
13,Having friends at a Elon run company the working conditions are as described by others here Elon wants it fast cheap and thinks he knows everything That can backfire literally when you deal with things like you know a controlled explosion The big thing I want to add here is that there is an issue with racism sexism etc in Elon run companies Example visible minorities have issues with promotion etc,22
14,I expect a lot of people will quit and I think thatll facilitate a change in work culture Like others have mentioned Im not sure that twitter didnt need a bit of shake up but Im not sure that itll be a super desirable place to work for any but Muskovites,18
15,I imagine its going to suck as a platform and as a work place Not that Twitter was some magnificent platform it was slightly better than Facebook imo but its just going to go back to where it was in 2020 before they started banning all of the disinformation and be a giant cesspool of shit That coupled with terrible work culture and most of the left leaning hating Elon I would imagine the user base is going to dwindle and the workforce will as well based on how terrible he treats his employees,17
16,I know the corporate culture was super woke internally and put a lot of emphasis on diversity and things of that nature Id imagine that is likely to changeNo clue about working hours although he did make some jokes about nobody ever being at Twitter HQ because everyone works from home,19
17,He expects everyone to work as hard as he does but with 110000000000000 000000000 percent of the pay,15
18,I think they will get worse Elon is known to demand his employees give their life to the company and work insane hours I fully expect that to happen at twitter,13
19,One of my biggest grievances with this take over is he hasnt said anything remotely close to the topic here I want to know exactly what he is going to change Shit posting on twitter about vague concepts or things that dont even make sense put the algorithm on github what doesnt do anything except make noise,11
20,Im more woried about the misogyny  racism increasing  The guy makes casual hitler jokes,13
0,Lol Twitter employees about to hit that 7am 9pm shift on the Tesla assembly lines,1156
1,I have a friend who is a Twitter employee She read the news got depressed then took the day off to go cyclingEdit Chill with the negative comments People are allowed to feel Thats what OP is asking about,930
2,ITT Everyone except for actual Twitter employees responding to the question,677
3,I think this is exactly what the Blind app is intended for,414
4,Dont work there but am curious also Elon isnt big on remote work and wondering how this will change their culture,326
5,Not familiar with the buyout process but if it includes buying vestedbutnotexercised stock options Id imagine theres a few happy campers right now,202
6,doesnt your average bay area tech worker change companies every 23 years anyways if they dont like it theyll just go somewhere else along with the constant shift of employees between companies here,180
7,Lol I hope he wrecks it Twitter is cancer,127
8,Why would twitter employees be here on Reddits,131
9,There is a lot of terrible responses surrounding MA and deferred comp All the execs have in their contracts change of control provisions that usually accelerates vesting pays out their salary for 23 years continues health benefits for at least 12 months and pays a performance bonus All employees with vested shares  options will be paid out Unvested options  RSUs for normal employees are subject to the acquisition contract When a company is acquired by another public company those are usually cancelled and reissued in the acquiring companies RSUs  options In a take private scenario there are several different routes they could go in terms of acceleration of deferred comp vesting Sometimes it is 0 and they are swapped for the private co partially accelerated or fully accelerated I would bet it is a partial acceleration with additional accelerated vesting if people stay on for X amount of timeEdit Checked their filing and as of 12312021 Twitter had 1565 million RSUs outstanding and 965000 options outstanding The weighted average strike on the options is 2711 firmly in the money and 934000 are vested will definitely be paid out They have 456000 PRSUs outstanding and 2921 million MBPRSUs outstanding with a weighted average threshold of 3164 firmly in the money Once the acquisition filing comes out we can see how they treat the unvested If people are curious I can do an executive comp analysis that will show much the exec team will take home for each person,88
10,Does that mean Twitter is moving the headquarters to Austin,90
11,Considering he said its not about the money I would guess many of them are headed out the door Can you imagine working many years head down through a storm vesting your stock and then your new bosses bosses boss is saying its not about the money,69
12,Some people seemed interested in what the twitter execs would take home from this Dont have a ton of time so I only did a couple of them Note that this is based on the proxy and the merger agreement will have the full disclosure around their parachutes This does not include the golden parachute tax gross up that will likely be paid to cover their tax liability on the gross up It does not include the impact of any sale of shares following 12312021 It assumes that no topping bid will come in and that the transaction will close at 5420 It assumes PRSUs will be considered to have hit all targets which may slightly overstate their PRSU payout Transaction close assumed to be 9302021 Salary as denoted below does not take into account salary collected until close CEOSalary  1000000 1 year worthHealth coverage  9229PRSUs  33351428 100 share vesting in the event of a change of controlTotal  34360657CFOSalary  600000 1 year worthHealth coverage  31210RSUs  35424036 100 share vesting in the event of a change of controlTotal  36055246,74
13,I know quite a few folks in cyber sec and for the most part its incredibly uneventful Its not going to be this badge of dishonor like having Theranos on your resume The whole leadership team is gonna get gutted though Considering the size of those golden parachutes nobody should send them any sympathy,68
14,As an actual Twitter employee I think its amazing I think its pretty sick and twisted how the higher ups purposefully try to twist narratives and control what people can say or think They let ISIS post tons of stuff without banning accounts though Its really messed up This is a big step forward for free speech againEdit at the SF HQ to boot,41
15,I am literally shaking right now,35
16,Im hoping a mass exodus Sadly Twitter is one of the few tech companies actually headquartered in SF Employees would have to commute to the South Bay for a lot of similar jobs,30
17,Overunder on the revocation of option to WFH in perpetuity,29
18,I hope the press sets up their own Mastodon even if on a parallel basis to Twitter The goal should be to make Twitter irrelevant I only read the journalists and certain bots,25
19,My friend is an exemployee who left due to a bad work environment The news sent him into a laughing fit  So take that for what you will,26
20,If I understand how LBOs work their stock gets bought out at 40 appreciation at close of transaction  That means they made a lot of money  Look out housing sellers bunch of kids with millions of bucks looking your way,13
0,Lol,156
1,More to do with concerns that Musk will sell his Tesla shares to pay for it Nothing to do with the actual value of Tesla This is a buy opportunity,153
2,Leave it to the Guardian to leave out 90 of the vital information from their reporting,75
3,This is such a horse shit headline The entire market is down on subpar tech earnings It has nothing to do with his purchase lol,40
4,The ENTIRE market is down and Tesla is down about the same amount as the market averages are This isnt a concern over Twitter this is the overall market just dropping,28
5,At this point my best hope for Tesla is Musk leaves gets humbled and come back like Jobs did for Apple Dude is taking his eye off the ball because hes starting to believe his own bullshit,28
6,Spend 45B to lose 126B I dont think this makes good financial practice,21
7,surely Elon owning twitter is the best thing for Tesla and SpaceX Hes protecting his only marketing channel,7
8,To quote Nelson Ha Ha,5
9,Or the stock was massively overpriced and any bit of unusual news will make the price drop,3
10,Oh darn,1
11,And Apple just keeps it in cash,2
12,Every time one company squires a second the price of its stock drops Now is the time to buy TeslaEdit tracker April 25 1005 per shareApril 26 876 per shareApril 27 899 per share,3
13,Ill gladly take those shares,2
14,TSLA will recover,2
15,Musk said he thought TSLA was overvalued like 2 years ago when share price was at like 100 I dont think he cares about any of this,1
16,Can you imagine being so rich that 126b is essentially a meaningless number to you,1
17,Looks like another click bait article,1
18,Its a buy opportunity thats all,1

2,My Thoughts about SKYH,98
3,I wonder what the implications of this would be for employees who have RSUs vesting if this does happen of courseDo they get all of their unvested RSUs converted to cash and then get yearly vesting cash bonuses until theyre fully vested,82
4,I dont understand why people are so pressed about his purchasing twitter Even if he exerted some type of control that people dislike they can move to another platform Edit see Facebook,78
5,The meltdowns on Reddit over this has been insane,29
6,Guess I need to crunch some numbers I think Musk has so much to lose and so little to gain I do not like to handwave decisions I disagree with as stupid or crazy He is not a freedom fighter There is more to this,17
7,I can see it now Muskie will smack talk stocks hell announce his candidacy for President hell unban Trump ban anyone he doesnt like and have great ads promoting the new car or your ride into space or his new NFTs or McDonalds This is 2016 all over again,18
8,The people who headline these articles are ridiculous They either dont understand the nuance or theyre trying to mislead The Twitter board accepted the deal That literally means nothing other than the fact the board will cooperate with the offer and recommend its acceptance to stockholders Nothing meaningful is accepted until the necessary number of stockholders vote to approve,20
9,Hopefully he can clean it up from bots,12
10,Great more elon spammanipulation,7
11,Prediction deal will fall through last minute because of something that show up during due diligence,7

2,Sure have all the freedom of speech you want When its an echo chamber of utter ignorance that speech is basically ignored The primary thing all these cousin fucking conservative morons are salivating over is getting their cult leader back on the platform It will see an exodus of ordinary folks Most people are using Instagram and tic tock for their self promotion anyway Twitter is going to go the way of MySpace,45
3,and after he changes the algorithm we will never hear about this again,36
4,What do we know about thisElon Musk gave a mysterious 57 billion donation weeks after he dared the UN to show him its plan for solving world hungerThe UNs WFP says it hasnt received a check from Musk yet Whether WFP receives any of Musks 56 billion donation is yet to be seen but I am excited to hear that Elon is engaged the organization said in a statementhttpsfortunecom20220215elonmusk57billiondonationweeksafteraskingunworldhunger,19
5,Not to defend Elon cause he fucking sucks but ending world hungry isnt a matter of just spending money  Its a systemic issue and it is a feature of global capitalism  Framing world hungry as a moral deficiency of our the US richest citizens is to belie great ignorance and more importantly it breeds a complacency and reinforces a Just World,14
6,Priorities ,5
7,republican fuckhead ,5
8,This is obviously the literal definition of evil to be able to end suffering and simply choosing not to,5
9,based on food waste alone hunger is not a money problem,4
10,Wait he never made the donation I thought he sent them 57 billion Did that fall through Seriously,3
11,I see this over and over and its such a bold faced lie  Beasley said 2 of Elons money could end world hunger as a means of providing a provocative quote to the press Elon said give me a plan where 6b solves world hunger and its yours Beasley took some time and then came back with heres a plan on how 6b would reduce world hunger See the trick yet Beasley said end world hunger as in gone completely everyone is fed because he wanted a good quote Elon called him on it and said show me how this works and Beasley couldnt because 6b couldnt actually end world hunger just put a dent in it Im pretty sure if it could end world hunger Gates would have done it already as an easy win 6b is nothing to many of these billionaires others could have stepped in and done it for the great press  if 6b actually ended world hunger it wouldntI appreciate the propaganda but get the facts straight Plenty of things to actually mock Musk for that are true and not just convenient slander,2
12,owning the libs is more fun Hes a raging narcissist Hell turn twitter into myspace its only a matter of time,2
13,The world has priorities and the poor are not it OrWorld hunger is necessary for this system to benefit who it is benefitting else it would have been eradicated long ago,2
14,He could have donated it but it could have ended up in administrative pocketsI live in California where the people serving the homeless community keep getting wealthier by hiring aids but the homeless situation isnt getting better people arent receiving services and I am angry about it  No more money for the helpers They put up conditions that dont allow people to live their own authentic lives,1
15,Hes not gonna make any money feeding the poor,1
16,I still dont understand what people have against free speech It has worked for us for the past 200 years Until the past few yearsDo people really support the system China has Or how Hitler used the press to turn people against the jews,1
17,But the real issue is pretending that the UN would actually properly allocate the handout they were asking for,0

3,Read leftists finally realize what weve been saying for 5 years now yet still miss the utter hypocrisy of their commentsMaybe they should have stuck up for their fellow Americans yesterday so that tomorrow they didnt have to worry The pendulum will always swing the other way Always,116

0,Its still not right from the perspective of Elon musk In the bottom 2 he needs to be right of center asking why the left has been radicalized or saying something like both are the same,57
1,Musk seems to be saying that the more money he gets the more fascist he becomes,41
2,Musk shows Lib progressives going too far but IMO what he did not show was how Rep conservatives keep back pedalingwhat happened to that 80 in the middle he was talking about,33
3,Ive never seen a more miserable billionaire Spends his days just trolling thirsty for attention  Unreal,18
4,If you can do thisWith the right running extreme show Elon Running with the Right And Then put Elon saying Look the left is running away,8
5,Accurate,6
6,Tbf itd be more the right sprinting further right while the left takes a long stroll towards the left and likes to stop to look at the scenery and maybe take a few steps backwards sometimes,7

13,This is my experience,1
14,My fears of Trump being elected President are that any person has a chance to become President if they can make the rightwing feel it will upset the libs  So I think Elon is laying the groundwork for running for President and with him owning the biggest soap box in the world no one will be able to ban him from using it to say whatever he wants to pander to Republican voter,1

0,Whats with people being mad at Elon buying twitter I heard arguments that hes going to turn it into a free speech platform so it will become filled with racists Its already full of racists,109
1,People do not understand that by buying twitter he is not just dumping 44 billion dollars into the bin his net worth is probably still the same,68
2,They are like you could save the whole world with those money but its barely enough to run the US government for 2 days,61
3,Any dollar amount in the 5 digits or more makes them feel confused and jealous,39
4,The absolute worst people in the world are the ones that actually try to argue that a given billionaire could snap his fingers and end world hunger or homelessness or any given problem but they just choose not to,21
5,Can we please not turn this into a sub that simps for professional conman MuskFuck communism but that does not mean love Musk,13
6,Its not like hes vaporizing the money Its going directly into the pockets of people who currently own the stock who themselves once purchased the stock So the question is why arent these leftists mad at those people But they are because those stockholders are their parents,8
7,Elon musk has 200 billion why didnt he salve world hunger US government spends 479 trillion every year about 200 billion of which goes to economic foreign add and still cant salve world hunger,3
8,Communists complaining and criticizing every single action the US government has madeAlso communists we need to give the government everything,3
9,They complain so much about elon they dont even stop to think that the US Govt spends 4 times elons net worth in a year and they call us dumb,1
10,People also claim its going to be a disaster and how hes going to fill it with his own agenda and shit and how bad a billionaire owning it is It was already owned by extremely wealthy people In fact theres a man named Alwaleed bin Talal who owns 52 of twitter and is an extremely wealthy Saudi Prince,1

3,I might add one more  If you believe Trump is our saviorEven though I like all the talking points above I only like Trump because he appears to be a disrupting force against our currently very crooked systemWhether that will turn it or destroy it is another question altogetherWhen Hillary et all go to jail and the FBI and CIA are disbanded that will only be ONE STEP in the right direction and that appears to be a step that is long and hard to make,243

0, making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humansCan anyone weigh in on the implications of making algorithms open source,569
1,,485
2,Before you can legislate free speech you have to define it Can you yell FIRE in the theaterCan you lie about what others say Can you say all speech is just opinion that theres no reality If I cant pump gas or take a dump without being bombarded with advertising is that advertising free speech,310
3,Getting rid of bots and authenticating human users is a nice start  But unless misinformation disinformation and lies are managed  itll just spiral into a 4chanlike cesspool,208
4,I quit Facebook around 2015 never used Instagram nor Tiktok or other amenities I use Twitter and Reddit and i have a feeling that probably in the near future i will end up just with Reddit I hope he will not buy Reddit too in the future,111
5,Number 5   allow the criminal clown back on Twitter to do more damage to democracy,73
6,,66
7,If all the conservative fanbois think Musk can or will just let Twitter be wild west where anything can be said they are vastly mistaken Even if he wants to his lawyers and 44 bill investment says otherwise,51
8,Ok so he owns a space based internet delivery system hes been chipping monkey brains and now has a social mediacontent platformwhat could go wrong,49
9,Musk fanboys are out in spades today,32
10,For 45 Billion imagine all the good you could have done with that money I would love to know his agenda,31
11,Your on the hour Elon Musk post,32
12,Twitter is going to become even more of a cess pool just now with more Qanon shit,24
13,For all the crazy he is he in the only billionaire to directly help the Ukrainians  And even though he stuck his foot so far down his throat that he managed to get a Guinness World Record he did try to help those kids in the cave  So insane as he is I do really applaud the efforts to stay connected to the suffering of real people  I have yet to see Bezos or Zukerburg do anything remotely close,18
14,Rebranded as Twatter,19
15,In 2018 the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk for   allegedly violating securities law after he tweeted that he had funding   secured to take Tesla private The SEC and Musk reached a settlement that required some of his tweets be preapproved though his lawyers are trying to end that agreementNobody is worried about that,15
16,Calling Twitter a digital town square as Musk put it is utter nonsense Twitter is a plexiglass bubble with a hole for a megaphone strapped to an electric scooter that travels at the speed of light Talk about free speech all you want but comparing Twitter to real human discourse demonstrates a spectacular misunderstanding for almost everything about humans reality and discourse,16
17,lul ChumpsI d my account a year ago and will never return,16
18,Is this the Elon Musk subreddit now,14
19,Has anyone considered Elon is actually a spam bot,10
20,I dont know why people cant recognize Musk is a highly effective leader Like him or hate him his companies flourish He acquires great technology and leads it well,10
0,is someone getting paid to put them on the airIn the sense that thats how ratings work yes,203
1,The Forbes episode was quite good Is Steve Forbes awful Yes Was he necessary a good fit as host No But the episode was mostly good sketches and his performance didnt ruin it,173
2,Lorne Famously said If you make the news you make the showOr something along those lines ,97
3,Im yelling at the theoretical billionaire comment Thank you Also kudos for SNL for also booking Rage Against the Machine when Steve Forbes hosted Thankfully they are touring again I think we need the ban lifted and they need to play SNL again,76
4,Iirc the Kim Kardashian episode was received pretty well on this sub,71
5,Surprise entertainers are better at entertaining than businesspeople,67
6,Im gonna sound really soapbox here  We as a society continually lump people like politicians and business moguls into the  entertainment category because we simply know their names SNL wants to drum up as much attention as possible so they open up the opportunities for people who sincerely dont know how to entertain The episode sucks but It doesnt matter because atleast people are talking about it and sharing clips all over social media I hope they continue to just stick to true entertainers like singersactorscomedians,56
7,Musk was the best of those three but it wasnt a great episode,27
8,All these years later Im still so very proud that I never watched The Great Pumpkins episodeAddendum I am referring not to David S Pumpkinsa classic sketchbut to the individual who hosted who possesses both obvious girth and an orange complexion and whose name I shall never utter again,23
9,I thought the Elon episode was entertaining Dont remember the Forbes one The Trump ep was a sht show,17
10,I think people who claim to see a pattern of billionaires hosting the worst shows are just projecting theyre saying its a bad show because they want it to be a bad showThe Forbes episode was actually a very good episode one of the best that season mostly no thanks to him  The Unabomber sketches he wasnt in were great weekend update had some of its best jokes  A couple of the sketches he was in the Pightline and Forbes on Forbes sketches were good as well not on his account but because the cast played off him wellElon Musks episode was all right  Nothing really classic about it but he did a decent job comparable to other nonentertainers and it had some good moments some of which were thanks to himThe Trump episode was awful  But its still 23 projecting,21
11,Is someone getting paid  favor to put them on the airYes its called ratings,16
12,Elon Musk as Wario tho,9
13,I mean who would have thought bringing a narcissist rich person with no talent in comedy or acting whatsoever would be awful to watch,9
14,Teve Torbes was kinda funny  He had a masculine Victor Mature scent,8
15,That Steve Forbes episode was great RATM got booted from the show before they played The skit where he wrote a book about the election and named the characters Teve Torbes and Lamar Alexander no2  And Elons episode was pretty good Thought they did well for having hosts that were not actors,10
16,Pretty sure Elon Musk is Latin for  perpetual cringe,9
17,The ladies loved Teve Torbes brilliant tax plan That and the fact that he had a musky Victor Maturelike scent,6
18,I think Lorne puts them on because he believes that a lot of people will want to watch them host not because he thinks they will do a good job,6
19,Steven Segal isnt a billionaire,7
20,Narcissism  comedic talent,6
0,Be great if he bought it and then immediately took it offline and closed the business 44B well spent,357
1,Does not look like any other potential buyer was willing to pay as much as Musk,65
2,Step 2 he will unblock trump to increase customer numbers and volumeStep 3 He will minimize itStep 4 he will sell it to Disney Microsoft  Apple,62
3,For some reason I feel its a good thing I never got into Twitter,64
4,Why,39
5,A global platform controlled by one person  accountable to no one and believes they are above the law ask the SEC What can go wrong,18
6,Will he or wont he give it away as the new Truth Social or Parler  He paid a lot of money to now be on the fence of if Twitter is for hate speech  He paid to have the Trump problem  Now Trump is his headache daily  Trump can only take value from something he can only do damage  Trump could be owned by anyone for a few million but Elon paid billions to be his nursemaid,17
7,Twitter soon to join the ranks of AOL myspace and prodigy in irrelevance,13
8,He fully bought it,14
9,Sohes gone crazy He hates his money He hates the world What does he do with Twitter and how does it work with his space laser,11
10,Damn he really just spent 44 billion so people can be allowed say antivax and probably transphobic stuff on Twitter again,12
11,Who do you all think Elon is gonna free first after hearing his free speech on Twitter campaign,7
12,Now buy reddit,4
13,d me account today No more kid following his jet allowed,4
14,Lol what if he sold it to Trump hahaba,4
15,I wonder what a privatized Twitter means,4
16,Starlink and Twitter could actually be used for great good in places like North Korea or Russia or Iran,4
17,What makes us think hell innovate with this He seems to have a history of buying existing companies promising new and exciting things and then nada,2
18,Best news on the marker recently,3
19,Amazing,3

0,A rich guy who decides to take over an existing social media company after so many other free speech populist alternatives fail to gain any ground kinda suggests to me that someone thought taking over an existing social network might work better than trying to build a disadvantaged competitor    Then again maybe it is just all about him having free speech,71
1,Free speech What government agency is muzzling him,41
2,This is gonna be one wild ride Thankfully I can just sit back and enjoy the shit storm since I never engaged in Twitter,26
3,Musk is no dummy he knows he can BS the right wing and theyll believe whatever Let the grifting commence,18
4,Musk is a hero to Trumpists He likes being that Musk,11
5,,12
6,rtechnology is now rpoliticsCongrats on fucking your sub up,8
7,Its embarrassing how all it took was him saying he supports Free speech to get a massive amount of support it means literally nothing Private platforms have absolutely nothing to do with free speech laws He is beginning his social media management by lying to people,9
8,Freedom of speech is determined by the owner of a property or platform Yo decide what can and cannot be said at your home The same as Musk decides in the Tesla buildings He didnt like what level of it was on twitter so he bought it in order to change it Completely consistent with private property rights,8
9,I guess since this is the Elon subreddit now I finally found an article about him that I will actually upvote,6
10,Yeah this is a silencing of the people of the world,3
11,Free speech as interpreted and implemented by the person who dictates what free speech they believe to be,6
12,Much to the surprise of fucking nobody,5
13,This article doesnt have any info about his anti union anti speech or anti worker actions This is a classic misleading headline Why is this even in r technology i would expect more from you guys,3
14,ITT people who should build their own Twitter are pissed off that Elon bought his own Twitter,3
15,When have any of those things ever mattered to mainstream outlets Look this person is rich We must tell you all about their trip to go shopping for new houses to put their money in,2
16,Dont forget that one time he farted that makes him the antichrists,1
17,Dont get me wrong Elon Musk is a narcissist piece of shit but wanting an  unfiltered Twitter and allowing anyone to express anything is not mutually exclusive with unionsHes doing it for himself Hes a free speech absolutist because he says ridiculous shit and has a cult followingHe wants to allow himself to do stuff without consequence like calling the guy that rescued miners in Thailand a pedophile because the guy got it done before Teslas bullshit device,3
18,The mainstream coverage I saw so far was mostly against musks Twitter purchase,1
19,Amazing isnt it The folks in charge of mainstream coverage are about as antiunionworkerspeech as Musk is They only like free speech that glorifies them,1
20,Hmm Im sure a guy who used this platform for plainly good reasons will keep it up now that he owns said platform,1

1,Hes right on both counts Truth Social is a fucking awful name,118
2,Now Im indifferent on Trump and I never really paid much attention to Musk but Im just wondering was Elon tweeting like this before Trump ran forbecame PresidentIm under the impression that powerful people started to follow Trumps lead in how to interact with the public,71
3,The Elon worship on this sub is fucking weird,48
4,Truth Socials TA had something in it saying the platform couldnt be attacked in posts  If it was all about free speech why add that,21
5,Thats hard fact This guy is tryna slip into my heartBut I dont trust himLol,14
6,Im sure those executives are are crying all the way to the bank,14
7,Elon Musk is a free speech absolutist yet censors his own workers and consumers and utilizes social media platforms and fame to illegally manipulate his companies stock He also never founded Tesla it was preexisting and he sued the founders for ownership and practically took it He was given wealth to start his shit campaign from family and friends He is not a person you want to trust when he says he believes in free speech,13
8,A completely uncensored unmoderated space on the internet will always turn into a cesspit If you allow slurs and racism people will leave to find somewhere more appealing Then all thats left on the site will be the people who wanted to say slurs and promote racism Its a downward spiral,11
9,Not a conspiracy Elon isnt your friend nor your champion,8
10,lol watching this sub rally around the richest person on the planet is hilarious,9
11,censored free speechWhat obligation does Twitter have to allow free speech in any form at all They can create a platform where youre only allowed to post nursery school rhymes and nothing else if they want Its not a free speech platform and its not run by the US government Its a social media company Moderation has been a thing on the internet for a very long timeIf you dont like it start another platform that is free speech with little to no moderation and watch it fail like they all do,7
12,you cant criticize trump on truth its all a work,6
13,Only bombs Elon is dropping are 43 billion on fucking useless Twitter instead of a much cheaper 6 billion bomb on world hunger when he said on Twitter he would if the plan was laid out Surprise surprise,2
14,True indeed,1
15,Hes right Truth Social is a terrible name,1
16,And Facebook And RedditIt wasnt just Twitter by any means But thats what Elon makes money on now so of course he is hyping it and his messianic role in the world,1
17,I mean hes not wrong,1
18,Maybe Elon will buy those Lesser Platforms next lol,1
19,And Tik Tok exists because Twitter destroyed Vine,1
20,Truth Social exists because they banned Trump,1
0,Anyone who fears Musks ownership of Twitter is simply announcing their preference for Twitter to remain a tool of the left It is hard to overestimate the significance of this event in the culture wars,148
1,The DNC has every right to be extremely concernedCompeting philosophies is the death knell to the DNC,65
2,I love this Finally these People are starting to see how much they wont be able to cover up lies propaganda Watching all of the snowflakes leaving Twitter is hilarious All on tictoc saying their leaving like we care I say good except they wont Their gonna realize they have nowhere else to go,53
3,Hes spot on,18
4,Musk response LOL u madI have no idea if hell do anything good for Twitter and I dont care Musk most likely is another megalomaniac wannabe authoritarian at his core but just watching the hilarity of this Twitter stuff play out is delicious And even if he is that bad he happens to be doing a genuinely good thing at the moment,3

0,Make a horrible change to the syllabus and then only let students who agree speak,372
1,Anyone who believes musk is doing anything more than giving lip service to free speech is a foolThis is a man who cancelled a customers order for saying not nice things about himHe didnt buy Twitter to ensure free speech He bought it to further his own wealth Its an investment nothing moreTo everyone saying Twitter isnt profitable hes used Twitter in the past to manipulate stock and crypto prices,357
2,Its pretty wild that weve got the government of Florida punishing a company for their speech and yet everyone is up in arms about Free Speech regarding a billionaire buying a social media platform,182
3,Just make sure your students understand the concept of free speech vs the constitutional right to free speech They arent the same People think they should be able to say whatever they want wherever they want without consequence No That is not how it works If Facebook doesnt want me posting kitten pics then that is against the concept of free speech not the constitutional right to free speech,158
4,The Twitter thing is is actually not about freespeech   There is no such thing as the right to free speech on someone elses property   Anyone discussing free speech on a privately owned website is uninformed and ignorant and usually does not care about anything but what is in it for themThe whole twitter thing is actually about private property rights and showing how they work better than government interferenceFor years the right has been crying that government force is required because they could not get their way on TwitterYouTubeetc and they have been continuously calling for the government to trample on the private property rights of Twitter so they can say what they want   But thankfully that did not happen that would be the destruction of private property as we know it into full blown totalitarianismAnd now what we have is Elon Musk is proving that the FREE MARKET works   He is showing that private property rights is what is really important  By owning Twitter he can do whatever he wants with it including making it more open to all  He can chose to make it allow more or less on the platform as he wishes and the government does not need to be involvedOf course now suddenly when the left feel like they have lost Twitter they are the ones who want Government to trample on private property rights so they can get their way  The left is proving how dangerous Government having a say over peoples private property rights would be so horrible and how it could be used to destroy everyones rights,89
5,But what do you mean when you say that certain speech should not be allowed How would we enforce thatOn a social media platform you disallow certain speech through moderation Banning accounts or deleting posts The class said no I then asked them why they thought that Jewish lawyers at the ACLU defended neoNazis right to protest in 1978 given that we know that the ACLU does not endorse NazisI think its rather flawed to compare social media platforms to the town square For one thing the town square is an actual public space Social media platforms are private spaces that just happen to allow almost anybody to use them Not quite the sameIf neonazis do a rally at a park or the KKK marches down main street you have a couple options Dont go to that rally or march or go to the rally or march and shout down the nazis or KKK members The only entity with the authority to stop those marches or rallies would literally be the government So thats obvious censorship Twitter is different Thanks to algorithms incredibly vile or dangerous speech can be signal boosted You can have these ideas shoved in your face against your will You can leave the platform much like you could avoid the KKK march Dont open the app or  your account But your opportunity to speak has effectively been destroyed Eventually if enough vile speech is allowed the platform dies and even more people have lost their ability to speak The platforms dont want this to happen Advertisers dont want to happen Fringe ideologues are the only ones who seem to want this to happen And Im sorry I just dont believe that Musk has this noble commitment to free speech Hes a skilled marketer and he knows there are people who will believe whatever he says Were just going to have to see what happens once he actually takes twitter over,66
6,d,40
7,Can you explain a little bit more the medias opposition to Elon Musks commitment to free speechAre you talking about opposition to Elon in general and getting confused why people are upsetIf a billionaire buying a corporation affects your free speech then youre admitting that free speech has a price tag on it and its sold to the highest bidderI am against Elon Musk because I do not believe billionaires should have the ability to affect my free speech one way or the other and I see no indication that the state of speech would improve in any way under himIf you support free speech that doesnt mean you cheer when youre under new management It means you dont want speech being managed at all,15
8,Nice good jobHope you dont have any negative repercussions,16
9,People dont oppose Musk because they hate free speech They think hes lying about supporting it Like he lied about ending world hungerhttpsnypostcom20211101elonmuskrespondstounclaim6bwillsolveworldhunger Or selfdriving cars by 2020 ccncomgreedyelonmuskpeddleanotherlietopocketheftypayday Or when he accused a cave diver of being a pedo cnncom20191203mediaelonmusktestifiesindexhtml Or when he publicly opposes subsidies but privately pockets them businessinsidercomelonmusklistgovernmentsubsidiesteslabillionsspacexsolarcity202112 I dont care about Twitter and think everybody bitching about Musk buying it should just  it But misrepresenting contemporary political issues to children is arguably worse,16
10,For the people saying free speech doesnt apply to private corporations due to free market principles thats only true in the sense that the US constitutional legal protections only apply to restrictions imposed by the government However the principle of free speech can still be discussed in the context of private actors in the sense of what they shouldshould not choose to censorAlso good on OP for demonstrating the purpose and basic principled defenses of free speech to a group of people who has been taught their whole lives that safe spaces are good and that hate speech and misinformationdisinformation need to be censored,15
11,Twitter doesnt have to guarantee free speech and the owner of the private platform is free to use it as he sees fit  That was true when the MAGAs were throwing a temper tantrum about daddy trump getting banned and its true now that Elon Musk owns the platform,12
12,I dont know why critics of free speech in the media cant do this that ones easy youre just overthinking itthey have bosses their bosses tell them what to thinksay Their bosses have an agenda Its simply about power and control,12
13,The intellectual backflips youre doing to avoid the word lie are pretty impressive Libel slander fraud theyve never been protected speech nor should they be,10
14,Elon Musk is not pro free speech In fact he tried to frame people for crimes for speech he disagreed with,9
15,Since when is free speech an inherent right when discussing a private company This isnt the government If there was a governmentrun social media site Id agree But why should a public company not have the ability to decide what they want on their platform This has nothing to do with free speech,9
16,this many elites are openly saying that free speech is not an inherent good and should be limited and they then dont consider the downsides of this viewpointSource  Those Ive heard are not against free speech but against Musks brand of free speech  He does not have a very good track record,8
17,No it is complicated Its always complicated We blunder when we insist on applying simple rules without consideration of context and nuance Screaming FIRE in the theater is the standard example of criminal speech   except sometimes there really is a fire in the theater We dont want to forbid the warning Is screaming the vaccines have microchips like screaming FIRE There was a panic among some in the theaterSo its not easy Its complicated Its always complicated And though the best solutions may be simple solutions based on simple analyses will tend to fail,6
18,outside of Musks claims of free speech commitments social media doesnt exactly have a good history of changing owners look at myspace and tumblr they crashed and burned because their new owners misunderstood their platform and why their userbase continued to use it One of Elons goal is to authenticate their users as actual human beings but if it means getting rid of anonymity it might do more harm to free speech on twitter than he claims and it might turn off a noninsignificant amount of usersFree speech on the internet hinges on anonymity no matter how ugly or dangerous it might seem,5
19,I feel like you are conflating the idea that a publisher would moderate content with the idea a government would punish its citizens for expressing an opinionIf I own a thing that makes money I get to decide how to operate that thing within the bounds of the law Deciding which opinions to publish or not is up to me If I want to filter out all criticism or Trump or Biden so be it Twitter should be allowed to do whatever they want  but we need to stop treating it like a national town hall and treat it for what it is  a huge money making machine that sells your information and ads If it were the best PR company in the world and a politician used it to get elected but then the PR company dropped said politician because they decided the politician was bad for business or even just decided they didnt like the politician  OF COURSE that politician is going to cry about being silenced Thats what politicians do Left right centerThats not free speech being violated,6
20,Stop comparing the terms and conditions of Twitter to free speech  Twitter can choose who and what it wants to censor and its no violating the first amendmentLet your students stand up whenever they want in class and say whatever they want whenever they want regardless of who else is talking or what activity youre doing  Let them stand up and shout the answers on quizzes and tests and then when you tell them to be silent they can complain that youre not allowing them their first amendment rights  The first amendment doesnt mean every media platform has to let you say whatever the hell you want  When people start going to jail for voicing opinions on Twitter then we can talk about free speech,4

4,Racists rentoid hating on the richest African American in the world No surprises there ,42
5,I dont like this  if he bought Reddit then we would all become his renthogs,35
6,Time to extract monthly rent from the Twitoids and evict the squatter deadbeats,31
7,Elon wants to increase freedom of speech You have to be careful with freedom of speech though It could mean allowing slurs and hateful comments against oppressed groups such as landlords,20
8,Yes freedom of speech Elon musk we all luv you ,18
9,I reactivated my Twitter today just so it shows up as another active user who is liking and sharing things I like the idea of metrics showing the site growing despite all of the Reddit crying,8
10,Elon Musk famously doesnt own a home and couch surfs at friends Hes even worse than a rentoid hes a house guest Kings youve been lied to,8

0,I hate twitter never signed up but might do just to bolster Musks numbers and prove a point,175
1,I get the strange feeling that bots that atrificially inflate Leftists are switching sides so if any investigation is done then it will blow up in the Rights face as it proves Twitter had a Right bias That or so they can suddenly drop all of the bots and make it appear as though Twitter is haemorrhaging users and Elon is to blameEither way I think it may be a setup or hit piece Maybe its just the pessimist in me,68
2,No way Stacey Abrams gets 1000 real followers per day,61
3,Probably bc conservatives are willing to trust Elon over Hipster Rasputin and his successor,49
4,The 2022 election results are going to look like the Twitter political sceneRepublicans will outnumber the democrats in the house and senate Just like whats happening on Twitter at this very moment Id bet money on that,26
5,Bots moving over to Conservatives Then when it goes fully open source the left would go ha they had an unfair advantage all along,15
6,I signed up in 2010 never posted havent logged on since 2013 occasionally anonymously browse  Know several others who did the same With all this going on will find my login and give it a shot  I would imagine there are many others like me that are doing the same,13
7,I may go back got tired of them censoring James Woods and others only for their opinions while progressives could exaggerate any thing they wanted  Hunter Biden was the last straw for me havent gone back since,12
8,Redownloaded Twitter the other day its been hilarious,5
9,All the Ghosts Biden type voters have returned to the Cemeteries only a few thousand real people who have filled us with BS are there Perhaps thats all that were ever there anyway,5
10,So pleased,2
11,Didnt read the article I have little concern with Twitter However this probably has nothing to do with censorship changes too early in the acquisition but everything to do with perception changes Conservatives know they wont be silenced liberals are mad and leaving the platform Either way its a win,3
12,All of my political followings are my representatives all CA demsIve been enjoying asking Swawell about his Chinese Honeypot regularly,3
13,That means theyll be moving to reddit Im sure of it,2
14,I used Twitter for the first time I simply tweeted Elon to unban Donald Trump and that is likely the only tweet I will ever send,2
15,Haha I thought musk was a libbo I guess hes a good guy,1
16,Lol where would the libs go,1
17,I signed up yesterday News orgs use Twitter for their story sources Free speech changes the dynamics of things,1
18,Wow,1
19,This is all nonsense while its going to happen nothing is official yet and nothing has changed with any algorithm This is just people freaking out to freak out,1
20,Nothing has been done yet Musk hasnt had any time to change anything yet It looks like all of the follower bots are being d,1

16,Freie Sprache,17
17,Ich verstehe den Aufruhr bei dem Thema wirklich nicht Twitter ist bereits beinahe vllig unmoderiert es gibt quasi nichts was Musk da gro verschlechtern kann Gleichzeitig droht die USRegierung schon seit Jahren in unterschiedlichen Formen damit SOcial Media Riesen mehr zu reglementieren Wenn Musk Scheie baut hauen sie ihm ein entsprechendes Gesetz vor die FeAlles in allem wird sich vermutlich nichts bei Twitter im aktiven Diskurs verndern und gleichzeitig hat Elon Musk ein beraus fragwrdiges und sehr teures Investment gemacht,18
18, Saudi Arabien ist einer der grten Einzelaktionre Twitter ist so quirky  Musk bernimmt Twitter um langfristig free speech zu gewhrleisten Zeit den Account zu lschen ,19

1,Are you implying that people are happy with government spending Because thats just not true,160
2,Bold of you to assume Im content with the federal government,80
3,The reaction of people is indeed very dumb,38
4,The level of I wish I could suck a rich assholes cock is astounding Fucking losers lol,21
5,urepostsleuthbot,25
6,I wonder if its because the people have lost all faith in the idea of government The notion that the government is supposed to help its citizens This complete lack of faith and trust makes them turn to the people with the most money as a means to solve the worlds ills,12
7,Well im not American so,6
8,why would i care how does it effect my life Elon can use his own money how he wants to,5
9,People dont understand it would cost Trillions to solve world hunger Imagine trying to give Africa infrastructure for transport fuel and vehicles to travel across Africa never mind making deserts viable for crop and could Africans even make that sustainable Colonists created some infrastructure and as soon as they left it went into disrepairFactoring in making Africa essentially industrial how would that then affect global warming in a place that is already extremely affected by global warmingWokists are truly dumb Im dumb I know that but hey you all make look smart Most people cant even give their local beggar a hand out the dirt and look at all the unemployed and problems in America never mind the world,6
10,Its weird business man doing business thing and people lose their shits   Like people that dont have 44b think they know what is the better use for 44b I think they just have eat the rich engraved in their brain I even live in a communist country and those people are too communist for me,3
11,In Fairness he did say hed solve world hunger if someone put forth a real plan Then the UN did And then Elon didnt I think its fair to be upset he spent almost 8 times the money on a vanity project Especially considering he took and didnt repay billions in pandemic loans Thats our money he used to stay afloat,4
12,if you had 43 billion and there is 7 billion people on this planet you could have given each person 1 billion and still have 36 billion guy,5
13,Ah yes money solves all It can make cures for disease out of thin air solve global environmental problems and create food to give to people instantly Not saying it cant help solve problems but it isnt some sort of magic that can change everything,1

15,You gotta love when people say oh you want something nice Go work for it and then a person does and suddenly its look how many people you couldve helped,3
16,Ah the fuckening,2
17,Bold of you to assume Im not screaming at the federal government as well,2
18,Reason he didnt solve the worlds problemsfrom my point of view I believe a world wide hostile takeover is frowned on in society Who knows I might be wrong and thats what everyone wants ,2
19,The political climate of the US is so sad these days  They should go back to having the leader of the opposition as the Vice President because the hatred is crazy youre gonna be in a civil war before things get betterEdit to Add  this is based off of comments not the dumb Elon meme,2
20,I  think Elon Musk is a rich asshole but I have nothing against billionaires spending on what they want Its not their job to solve all the worlds problems even if they could,2

0,The hags at the View want to end free speech for Straight White Men,458
1,Free speech for all except those the left doesnt agree with,158
2,Lmao its been 1 day,156
3,To be fair they probably need free speech protection the most,145
4,straight white men are the least free to speak of anyone in america right now weve been bent over and turned into prison wives by the leftists on social media so she can chill,135
5,I mean free speech allows morons like this to say the dumbest things Im okay with it cause Id rather live in a world where you able to freely speak your mind no matter how idiotic it is,91
6,Its straight white men that get banned from Twitter while non whites like the subway shooter and taliban post violence  so this will help protect free speech for straight white men but also everyone else,48
7,,36
8,Why do they hate white people,36
9,Hes actually African American,31
10,Thats quite a racist thing to say,23

18,I was wondering why I had to send a copy of my drivers license and birth certificate proving I was in fact a white male to log into Twitter this morning,6
19,I cant even drum up the slightest bit of empathy for this lunatics anymore  They literally have to lie and make up weird stories in order to be enraged about something,6

0,Open source algorithms killing the bots free speech and endtoend encryption Sounds good Will wait and see if it actually is good though,409
1,Talk is cheap Do it,348
2,One thing i have learnt from Twitter is that never trust Elon musk,210
3,He didnt buy Twitter to make it better for users He bought Twitter to make even more money for himself,147
4,anyone has experience with Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter,42
5,Facebook did this and no one actually believes they dont have keys,31
6,Elon Musk iswas chummy with Peter Thiel I wouldnt trust jackshit he says he plans to do to improve user privacy Especially on a giant social media platform which is the antithesis of privacy,35
7,Assuming Elon Musk actually buys Twitter Im skeptical the deal closes hell take it private right I would think an opensourced company hostile to data gathering isnt going to garner much interest from market investors,22
8,What happened to the kid who was logging musks jet,14
9,Wow this would be a step in the right direction Imagine how much security would improve everywhere if companies did this correctly Skeptical if it actually happens,8
10,Tesla has shown again and again that they collect way more data from drivera than they claim As soon as the police knocks on the door they can provide camera footage acceleration and steering data gps location In many cases the user only partially agreed to some of the things being sent of to tesla but tesla collected way mlre stuff anyways because fuck privacy,7
11,It doesnt matter PRISM still exists and even Elon cant do anything about it,8
12,Heres howBy making broad proclamations without any discussion with the engineers and without any plans to change a damn thing,7
13,Why does it have to be like Signal Cant it just be exactly that WhatsApp used to use the signal protocol theres no reason Twitter cant do it as well,5
14,Handling endtoend encryption is difficult on multiple devices much less on a web site It will probably work like WhatsApp on the web where youll have to use your phone to scan a qr on the web version to login,6
15,Good luck to him on finding a cost effective way to eliminate bots without pissing off your user base,5
16,rofl if elon is suddenly doing this its surely for the sole purpose of selling these tweets to intelligence agencies  Hes the walking definition of modern evil,3
17,Feels like this could be good also feels like maybe this could be a way to avoid some sort of tax obligations Billionaires are sneaky like this,2
18,Haha no,2
19,Hes all encrypted talk,2
20,Making DMs require using the twitter app or messages just disappear when using a browser,1
0,Elon Musk on Tuesday criticized Twitters top lawyer for banning stories on Hunter Bidens laptop after it was reported that she cried when talking to staffers after the deal had been completed and Musk had bought the social media platform on MondayWhen the ludicrous amount of power you hold comes crashing down  Arrogance plain and simple  Thats all these people have  To see them eat a piece of humble pie after so many years of bullying is bliss,76
1,Soon to be Twitters former top lawyer,67

20,what democracy,1
0,Free speech is so epic except when it favors who I dont likesEdit for clarity Im on Elon Musks side Im making fun of the people who advocate for freedom of speech but then get mad when they realize that Twitter will no longer be an echo chamber for them,175

7,Whoever wrote this garbage is a partisan hack with no interest in actual economics Rubbish,23
8,But those who want to control which voices the public hears do understand democracy,20
9,Look at the source and discard,11
10,please leftists just stop and go outside for a while until this blows over lol,10
11,Omg here we fkn go You cry baby democrats need to learn what freedom is,7
12,Nooo twitter has to be controlled by advertisers trying to maximize share value It cant just be controlled by Musk Democracy,8
13,Youre the same genius who on another thread thought Musk could  give away 1mm to each individual in the US  all 330mm of them  with his 44 Billion Youre an ignorant fool trying to tell people what to think  Go back to school and learn some simple math skills before you go around pontificating about what Musk does or doesnt know  When you start actually being a productive member of society rather than trying to mooch off of someone who has created massive wealth for himself and thousands of others then maybe you would be worth listening to,8
14,When will all this impotent opinion dribble stop Like I give a fuck what someone with an axe to grind thinks,5
15,They should get along then Twitter doesnt know the first thing about free speech and democracy,5
16,None of this has anything to do with the economy Why is it here,4
17,Why is this liberal bullshit popping up,1
18,Looks like liberal crying to me,3
19, He knows enough Libs are just upset they cant censor free speech,4
20,Like a billionaire knows all about democracy since they have that much money by selling things people want to buy We make billionaires by voting with our wallets,3
0,Thats the elephant in the room right There is no ideological diversity on Twitter and other platforms,146
1,Looking at the list of companies it appears that there is a direct correlation between sitting and staring at a computer screen all day and being a leftie,81
2,Musks company tesla is even on this list The mental gymnastics these people go through must be backbreaking,60
3,Weird that the dems keep saying that republicans only work for the rich yet one of the bigger american compaines sponsor mostly democrats OHH THE IRONY NEVER STOPS DDD,26
4,Look at all the diversity,19
5,This is the real reason the left is scared right now Dont let them try to convince you otherwise,6
6,Imagine donating to a political party,7
7,For the left the biggest takeaway from this graph is that they need to start doxxing Oracle employees,8
8,Noob question  How do they know the employer of the donor  Do you have to report who employs you when you donate more than 200 to a candidate or campaign,5
9,Watch for blue check marks screeching Oracle is a far right corporation that needs to be taken down,5
10,Shadow banning is already stopping Buck and Clay are reporting that they have gained 10k followers in one day since Musk bought Twitter That is a big number for social media gains,3
11,No theres no leftist bias in the tech and social media spaces at all NONE AT ALL,3
12,Theyre deathly afraid that the same censorship that has been levied against us will be used against them but they still havent figured out that we arent the party of censorship We have never advocated for silencing liberal voices nor have we advocated for deplatforming themThey wouldnt survive their own treatment if the tables were turned,3
13,Well its hard to track these stats sometimes because conservatives dont put what company theyre with when donating In fact I always put im retired and Im 25 lolol,1
14,Its funny they had to get all the way down to Facebook before the red bar could accommodate numbers,2
15,I hope he fires the entire Twitter staff and hires those appreciate free speech and open dialog And I truly hope its a mixture of people from both sides of the aisle Makes for better dialogThis is a great thing I just hope he stays strong and safe and doesnt end up Hillaryd,2
16,Doesnt this just imply that educated competent professionals overwhelmingly lean left,1
17,How much of this is from singular individuals like CEOs They invested in control of the web,1
18,This might sound crazy but couldnt this graph just indicate that the working class under the companies listed might just miiighhht lean left instead of right And with the money they earn from the jobs they hold here decide to donate to the political party of there choosing I mean if more employees held republican views and those employees chose to donate the the party of there choice The graph would indicate that correct Or is this graph fake news,1
19,They cant stand anything less than lockstep agreement because they are incredibly insecure,0
20,to be fair its those who are willing to answer,0
0,I like Elons style     Doesnt mince words,198
1,Can someone clear one thing for me Dont electric cars use lithium and isnt lithium mining really bad for the environmentEDIT thank you for all the responses,77
2,I like some of what Musk has said and done lately but the whole article looks like a tribute to a narcissist Not really politically relevantGates Sorry to say I havent closed it out I would like to discuss philanthropy possibilitiesMusk Sorry but I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla the company doing the most to solve climate change,40
3,d,16
4,,12
5,Fair Though obviously Tesla is overvalued,9
6,I mean its pretty much nonsense First of all a short just means that Bill thinks the companys stock is overvalued Which it totally is btw and having a short position doesnt hurt Tesla particularly  and therefore doesnt hurt the environment even if you buy the premise that tesla is somehow a super duper environmentally friendly company which is arguable,8
7,Awfully bold to state that not supporting your company  not supporting climate change Its just virtue signaling,4
8,I think one element people are missing here is that if Tesla didnt exist electric vehicles wouldnt even be on the horizon in our lifetimeNo one would have gone for the risk and fought through all the bullshit he went through to get it off the ground Now we have charging stations everywhere and electric vehicles are viable for other manufacturers to produce,3
9,Bill is a ginormous hypocrite He has to fly to his mansions and properties within California instead of taking public transportation like most democrats advocate the rest of the country to do He also had to demolish a perfectly good mansion to build his bachelor pad No climate waste there,3
10,Can someone ELI5 what short means in this context  Is it that Gates has money invested in Tesla,1
11,So once all the gas vehicles have been converted to EVs the need for lithium and other metals will drop substantially because the metals in the batteries can be recycled Gasoline and oil are lost for ever once used to fuel vehicles Lithium batteries will last about 500000 miles and  can be recycled over and over EVs are 1000 x better for the environment and dont require war like oil Once the world drives EVs both the Middle East and Russia will loose the majority of their funds and not be able to afford war or terrorism Its game over for oil,1
12,Im sorry can someone explain what hes talking about short positions,1
13,Thats why Lol Okay bud,0
14,Where does Elon think the electricity for his cars are made from its just as bad as gas gusslers until were totally dependent on solarwind,-3
15,If Elon made a Musk Id wear it,-4
16,Lol how conservatives deal with this headline they just cant lol,-5
17,He also likes private jets and children Neither of which are very carbon neutral,-5
18,Bill Gates is evil  nothing new,-6
19,,
20,,
0,Makes no difference to me Let Twitter turn into the wild wild west Might actual be fun honestly,185
1,Remember authoritarians if you dont like it you can just go start your own Twitter,120
2,Can he just make twitter less of a pain in the ass to use No one wants to read a 10post thread in equal 250character parts,120
3,That would be wild to see him move Twitter HQ to Austin and fuck the Bay up,103
4,And just like that the stocks behind Trumps social network are down 12  I have to hand it to him with this move he can mess with both liberals and conservativesTrumps already said he wont rejoin Twitter in favor of his own network which makes sense since he got people to invest in it Meanwhile liberals are all worried about some doomsday scenario where conservatives suddenly own Twitter,93
5,Reddit gonna have a full melt down In other subs people are throwing full on tantrums just cause now the public can watch both sides argue instead of just a giant circle jerk echo chamber that twitter was They banned the orange man but let putin and the taliban tweet Lmao Im glad they sold out to elon,37
6,Im honestly interested to see how this plays out  Just because hes taking Twitter private doesnt mean it wont need ad revenue from big corps  Will those corps continue to advertise on Twitter if Musk makes it a true free speech arena  Imagine a Disney ad popping up next to some Twitter rant filled with hate speech  Im grabbing some popcorn  At a minimum itll be interesting,31
7,Private company becomes even more private continues to not be a first amendment issue,27
8,Easy to see who the fake libertarians are here,25
9, Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated Musk said in a statement included in the press release announcing the 44 billion deal I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans Twitter has tremendous potential  I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock itAnd as mentioned in a different article On Monday after the Journal reported that a deal was close Mr Musk tweeted to indicate that he wants the platform to remain a destination for wideranging discourse and disagreement  I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter because that is what free speech means he wroteI trust he will remain faithful to those words,24
10,I wonder if hell stick to his guns and reduce overall moderation Or eventually go for the money and appeal to advertisers by increasing moderation again,21
11,If he stays true to his goals for Twitter that will be a good thing however the way I see this going is he is going to realize just how dead twitter is without bots constantly tweeting about meta topics much like how reddit would be dead if the bots were delt with,19
12,Good,20
13,Elon is only doing this to ban that one kid from Twitter from tracking his flights,12
14,With Elon Musk buying Twitter expect liberals to suddenly care about billionaires owning social media while ignoring how they empowered billionaire big tech corporations to censor anyone that challenges their prowar prooligarchy narratives,13
15,If anyone is thinking that a centibillionaire owning twitter is somehow going to increase freedom of speech Ive got a bridge to sell you,9
16,Awesome I cant wait to see what changes he makes and who gets upset,10
17,Maybe now Ill make an account,6
18,Damn might make a Twitter account,8
19,Being banned on a social media platform is not a violation of your first amendment Youre still allowed to go outside and yell whatever bigoted shit you want,6
20,the meltdown on twitter right now is hilarious,4
0,The human centipede of bluechecks now on suicide watch,625
1,Well libs looks like its time for you to do your speech about how Twitter is a private company and can regulate speech on their platform however they want ,624
2,unaffected,470
3,Muskrats will really never shut the fuck up now,273
4,did people complain this much when Bezos bought TWP,205
5,Hes doing it just to get back at everyone who made fun of him on Twitter he confirmed this,158
6,Its refreshing to see a billionaire maybe attempt to increase free speech instead of just have sex with children,155
7,Libs on rnews panicking that this means trump will win in 2024,131
8,Twitter is a cesspoll of That encourage Dunking Behavior with 140 charactersSeriously just look at all the Politicians that have the most follower it about making dumb statement and having your base eat it up Or having  people dunk on you in under 140 character,117
9,Im really surprised because I never thought the board of directors and shareholders would agree to sell,115
10,Damn I really did not think this was going to happen,89
11,Musk has built three companies SpaceX Tesla SolarCity on the same business model find an unprofitable nonIT technology leverage money from your last business eg emerald mine from daddy to become the dominant market player milk government subsidies to achieve profitability hype yourself as a wizbang high tech revolutionary entrepreneur selfmade man Given how tightly he has latched on to the government tit this move is interesting We have seen the capture of the dominant social media and IT platforms by congressional Democrats since 2016 as threats of regulation to preserve democracy were correctly understood by Bezos Zuck et al to mean act as our propaganda platform or else Now Musk corporate welfare queen 1 is buying up the crown jewel of Beltway courtier social media Is there any doubt that he will be working hand in glove with his patrons in Washington Private company  no need for accountability to shareholders or any other member of the public He can continue to run Twitter at a loss indefinitely and the congressional Dems will make sure he is compensated in various other ways,88
12,Gotta support an AfricanAmerican owned business,73
13,The censorship on Twitter is obvious and someone should do something about it but Elon Musk is a major player in areas the establishment would not allow a loose cannon to operate so I have to assume this whole thing was cooked up to make it look like a victory for free speech when they are just going to secure the right side of the Overton Window and pretend the 1st amendment was saved It will be nice to see people once again have the ability to speak out against the liberal side of the culture war but the Military Industrial Complex will be as protected as ever,64
14,I always find it fascinating and sad how vehemently despised the early ideals of the internet are nowadays In 1996 you had the EFF and John Perry Barlow publish A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace which states We are creating a world where anyone anywhere may express his or her beliefs no matter how singular without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity This document was wildly popular and published all across the web in the 90sNow in 2022 the reaction to this concept by most redditors and bluechecks seems to be abject horror since they credit every single victory the rightwing has had to freespeech on the internet existing and allowing the rubes to be tricked by lies 2016 broke their fucking minds It was her turn goddamnit,66
15,For all the blue checks screaming in fear its simple you dont like a platform just build your own,68
16,Looks like donnie tweets are back on the menu boys,66
17,honestly surprised Bezos didnt buy twitter he could be suppressing unions at a level unheard of,64
18,I know some artists I follow are having a real one about how Musk might kick them off the platform which seems ridiculous,47
19,Theyll not get close to a better offer Its a dwindling interest that could be replaced by a variety of media in the coming years or at least diminished to the point where such offers would be ludicrous The loons who believe in corporate responsibility will be outraged but this was always going to happen,44
20,On one hand allowing a single billionaire to rule on what can or cant be said on a massive internet forum could be inexpressibly crippling to free speech and working class mobilization against elite interests On the other we have successfully owned the libs,41
0,With the way a large portion of people online still think the world of Musk and are utterly convinced that his buying of Twitter is supposed to usher in this new era of free speech I really doubt anyone will be leaving in droves,112
1,The irony of tweeting this,97
2,The text at the bottom of the screen says Peace right,52
3,Just like Im moving to canada,33
4,Lmao aint no one leaving This whole thing is like watching children whine to their parents,30
5,When twitter users wake up and realize they been stuck in S2,26
6,People are really getting worked up over which unfathomably powerful entity controls our social media platforms,18
7,it will become facebook and destroy one or 2 democracies doesnt it,10
8,Sois Elon White Rosemixed with TyrellI Genuinely hate Tesla fan people,7
9,Bet Sam does not leave,6
10,Everyone up in these comments upset about a joke,5
11,Anyone who sees this as a bad thing is the bad thing,4
12,one more thing The simps for elon on this thread are astounding,1
13,If you think free speech is bad youre a fucking moron that doesnt deserve it Move somewhere that doesnt have free speech Or buy your own Twitter so you can limit free speech all you want,0
14,Theyll forget about it in a week Truth is all social media is owned by billionaires whether they like it all not At least this one has a shred of personality Free speech this free speech that yeh whatever,0
15,This is something Elliot would like no why are people suddenly outraged like the other 99 of social media isnt owned by millionaires lol,-4
16,lets just point out that elon musk could have ended world hunger but instead bought twitter for the good of the peoplex200Bedit here is the link to the claim that elon made where he would put up the money if someone told him how to  weforumorgagenda202111elonmuskunworldhungerfamine,-5
17,,
18,,
19,,
20,,
0,I dont trust any billionaire to protect free speech nor do I trust them to define it,118
1,So the guy that fired workers for wanting to unionize suddenly cares for free speech Kek,95
2,Im going to predict It wont actually be completely free speech He wont make the algorithm open source Donald Trumps Twitter account will be back,70
3,And ban teenagers that track jets of billionaires,54
4,hes lying is a terrible fraud and will run twitter like his personal PR machine even more than he currently does to pump his companies stock prices and crush growing labor movements If you have an ounce of faith in Elon Musks ability to do anything beyond cosplaying as lovable weird nerd who just wants to use his hardearned billions to fix the world I feel bad for you He is exemplary of the degradation of democracy at the demand of privatization and should be globally hated for many things but for me it is enough to hate him for the unfathomable wealth disparity he represents We used to use the fruits of the nations labor on public works projects Now we use our taxes to fund billionaire manchildren who waste the money on stupid pet projects and spit in our faces,53
5,He also plans to authenticate all humans businessinsidercomwhatwillelonmuskchangeabouttwitter20224 which will probably mean he will start to require more personal information about their users,53
6,Maybe Ive been hearing that phrase too often recently but to me supporting free speech seems to be more meaningless virtue signalling than anything of substanceAlso consider that these are the carefully selected promises of a businessman not of someone who is an expert on social media communications While I appreciate his visions Ill take them with two heavy grains of salt,44
7, authenticating all humansAh papers please Show your passport to get on the internetFantastic ,46
8,d,32
9,the oxymoron of a privately owned platform for free speech ,26
10,Hes a lying piece of shit just like hes always been Oversell and under deliver Hes not gonna make the algorithm open source and hes not gonna be some free speech warrior Hes just buying it as a means to his own endWhat a broken fucking system when one human being can just singlehandedly buy such a powerful tool of information control,26
11,There are millions of people in the US starving or unable to afford medical bills or basic care Then this asshat takes FU money and just buys Twitter for 44 billion He is a horrible person and I hope his plans crash and burns and he ends up bankrupt,23
12,Authenticate all humans umm,29
13,Billionaires arent your friends and their agendas are likely not in line with yours  Be weary of whatever he intends Maybe itll turn out okay but then again ask Tesla or SpaceX employees about the mandated work hours unionbusting or large donations to GOP candidates,24
14,Opensourcing the algorithm is nice but authenticating all humans is dystopic I dont trust him one bitIn the first place we need to stop using platforms social media for entertainment like reddit or twitter as platforms for political speech People complain about echo chambers all day long even though the system is working fine  its just not meant for this sort of usage,28
15,The minute workers want to unionize well see how pure mr free speech is,26
16,Town squares arent privately owned,23
17,As long as it includes the free speech of Tesla employees who want to unionise,21
18,Free speech  right up until he doesnt like what people are saying,18
19,I predict the beginning of a downfall Man has been ego boosted so much he thinks he can do anything,19
20,10 says all talks of unionizing will be banned,17

0,How long until the Theyre a private company they can restrict who they like people do a straight 180 and start crying for the state to nationalize twitter,349
1,Apparently things are actually moving towards Musk buying Twitter What are the implications Would the platform change and how,150
2,I have a feeling this is going to be a repeat of Im moving to Canada if Trump wins  Lots of people screeching and already are and after about a month everything will calm down,129
3,I expect scores of subreddits will spontaneously pin comments demanding the Government save Twitter from the Bad African American Man,85
4,I was just reading the rtechnology thread on this and already seen so many people in panic because OH MY GOD HES GONNA LET TRUMP BACK ON THE SITE as if thats the worst thing to happen since Hitler Some people are just so fucked in the head Im not sure why people are freaking over Musk buying Twitter but I do hope he allows for more freedom of speech because its very clear what kinda agenda Twitter has as of right now Also if he did ban all Anime PFPs on Twitter that would be INCREDIBLY based,47
5,IF this actually goes through and isnt blocked at the last second with some nonsense technicality and IF Elon actually keeps his promises then this is in my opinion THE most significant defeat woke authoritarianism has suffered since the start of the culture warHaving one of the major big tech platforms fully reset its rules back to the free speech social libertarian ethos of the early internet is HUGE  Simply the ability to push back against SJWs on twitter without having to treat them with kid gloves answerable only to the same rules THEY must abide by is huge  Being able to expand our reach without secret algorithms hiding our views and promoting theirs without any of our accounts that get big being huge targets for journo doxxing with impunity oopsie suspensions or bullshit bans is huge  Not having to worry that entire stories and events will be forbidden because they go against the narrative is huge  Imagine the REEEEE the first time a CNN reporter doxxes someone and gets banned for doxxing exactly like the rest of us would if wed done it  Or in the alternate we are free to retaliate in kind and doxxing is only punished for either party by its actual criminal definitionRemember the glory days of 20142015 when we could take over any antiGG hashtag at will because we had the numbers  When SJWs had to actually argue with us instead of just run to trust and safety  Even in the face of relentless media smears we had so much momentum because we have the numbers we have the better arguments and SJWs just cant handle debate on equal ground they HAVE to have unfair advantages they HAVE to have authority figures backing them up or their crybullying doesnt work and they fall apart  Wokeness cannot thrive under scrutiny nor in the face of dissent it cannot deplatformIf Elon keeps his promises we win and twitter is ours  That is MASSIVE,48
6,When it first goes through it will be fun to throw the Its a private company it can do what it wants in the faces of all the people bitchingThat said it still remains to be seen what Musk will actually do Hes a billionaire which makes him completely untrustworthy He could simply have a hard on for free speech and want to push twitter back to more how it was in the early 10s or so which would be a great thing He could however just be doing shitty billionaire things because he thinks he can leverage twitter somehow into making more money I guess he could do both at the same time technically which would still keep his image of being le based billionaire,33
7,Im actually reading a book on Twitter Hatching Twitter Only about 90odd pages in but there seems to be an awful lot of backstabbing going on amongst its founders and early employeesAlso Irrespective of whether Musk buys Twitter or not Im not going back to that awful website,34
8,Blue checks on suicide watch,24
9,I doubt anything changes but the meltdowns will be worth itNo platform will ever have twitters level of influence and be a leftist propaganda machine like this ever again,27
10,Holy fucking shitIll believe it when I see it but thats awesome I cant wait to see it play out,21
11,Theyre already freaking out as if the world was going to descend into an era of eternal darkness never seen before in human history Its hilarious,18
12,Please unban Trump It will be hilarious,13
13,Can I get my Twitter account back,12

15,Left in shambles,11
16,Pendulum shift,7
17,Well there goes any chance the democrats had at winning any future elections,8
18,I do not see anything changing for the better twitter is just a fundamentally bad platform for any discourse Its a place for takes and news feeds its corrosive to the well being of the users regardless of censorshipFor Elon the deal is a poison pill I have no idea what he sees in Twitter as a company If I were a Twitter shareholder I would accept the bid,8
19,If Elon buy it and shut it down I would laugh for yearsAt least is a promise that he kept,8
20,Thousands of Blue checkmarks weeping in pain as we speak right now,8

2,This is the guy I work with that doesnt know the meaning of personal space and keeps trying to convince me  that whats wrong with this country is its Bidens fault that theres a shortage of stuff around world and its his fault everything is expensive,19
3,Hes telling her the advantages of men under 55,15
4,Plot Twist Elon really only bought Twitter to ban the guy who kept tweeting where his airplanes were going and didnt take the 5000 bribe to stop,16
5,He is gonna sell twitter toxic credits for billionaires to emit demented dialogue And ban comebacks for rest of us to prevent global twitter implosion,5
6,Dark Order rep,6
7,Looks like the guy is about to go apeshit on her and she knows it,4
8,In the end the only thing he cares about is money and power so I fully predict hes going to stay true to his promise of allowing misinformation to run rampant but completely abandoning his promise to eliminate the bots,4

4,Musk tweeted Thursday that hes able to maintain the Tesla workforce because the company compensates and treats its employees well Because of this Musk claimed hes not worried about union organizing at his companyThats completely BS this is the same Tesla company that has racial segregation at its factorys  theguardiancombusiness2022feb10californiasuesteslaoverracialsegregationclaimsatfactoryAnd this isnt surprising when you consider that musks dad made his money by owning an emerald mine well he lived in apartheid South Africa businessinsidercozahowelonmusksfamilycametoownanemeraldmine20182Tesla needs to be unionized,93

6,Garbage like this only makes sense if you buy into the Republicans hate democracy and Jan 6th narrative A quick scan of rpolitics front page shows you the truth of how far bought in these people are The dissemination of information is KEY to what the Dems are trying to do to this country It terrifies them to their core that theyre starting to lose that We all have our biases but it takes an insane amount of it to see threat in free speech,24
7,1st of all we have a republic Secondly  shut up,23
8,Doesnt she mean its dangerous to our Democratic party,18
9,Shes just greedy and clearly jealous of Musks wealth Shes the epitome of what communism is all about envy,19
10,Every time I hear stuff like this I keep wondering what this magical indicator is that Elon Musk is so bad The guy literally said he wanted greater transparency Shouldnt the Democrats at least try to hide their hatred for the truth,16
11,The United States are not a democracy Anyone who says they are is deceived or deceiving,15
12,Operative word being our As in THEIR democracy which of course  isnt a democracy,14

10,The right wont be mad because the right still believes in free speechThe right might be mad at some of the posts but they would still die to defend a persons right to make those postsThe left used to agree with this classic liberalism has a lot of principles against tyranny and unnecessary wars for free speech equality standing up to tyranny and civic disobedience when appropriateall of these principles were abandoned and only one remainsLoyaltyThe lefts only remaining principle is loyalty to the left so now they are for both tyranny and unnecessary wars if they are started or continued by a Democrat and against free speech if they dont like it against equality unless its for Democratic voters against civic disobedience unless they are the ones doing it etcBut they are loyal to their party and their side no matter what they say or do no matter what crimes they commit no matter what tyranny they imposeLoyalty is the only principle the left has left,1
11,I just want an open platform where hate speech is defined as doxing or directly telling someone to unalive themselves not a vague whatever is convenient at the moment definition,1
12,It should not be comfortable but open,1

6,Chupa bola de Elon Musk me d nojoE aqui t cheio bizarro como tem otrio pra dar mais poder pra quem no presta mas n no  nenhuma novidade,16
7,As pessoas superestimam tanto isso do Trump com Twitter Parece at que ele tem um dedo mgico e tudo que ele digita  impossvel de resistir,11
8,Caralho voc tem noo do quo assustador  o fato de que UMA pessoa pode simplesmente comprar uma das seno a maior plataforma de rede social do mundo que pode moldar a opinio pblica e destino de naes inteiras Completamente do nada um maluco bravo com a censura de uma empresa privada na prpria plataforma solta mais de 40 bilhes e compra a empresaBilionrios so uma ameaa pra humanidade cara Eles vivem num plano diferente da realidade de todos ns e no tm absolutamente nada ou ningum que possa manter eles sob controle que eles no possam comprar Entre culto de personalidade doentio grtis e mais dinheiro que o PIB de um pas pequeno pra comprar o que tiver afim esse tipo de pessoa  assustador e no deveria existirPau no cu do Elon Musk pau no teu cu que defende ele pau no cu do monte de velho carcomido que  o governo americano que sempre deixou isso acontecer e pau no cu dos outros bilionrios,12

12,Impresso minha ou essa postagem foi flodada pelos lunticos do brasillivre,3
13,So venho lembrar que o twitter s  grande e influente porque todo mundo s fala dele principalmente no brasil O pinterest tem 3x mais usurios no brasil por exemploTodo mundo odeia o twitter e fala que  o esgoto da internet ento parem de usar isso e deixem morrer logo,7
14,Como que um cara to retardado que s fala merda faz pump and dump no twitter por sinal que promete um mundo de coisas e no completa nenhuma e que no cumpre prazos conseguiu ficar bilionario  Ps conquistas tipo SpaceX Tesla entre outros so mrito de profissionais extremamente qualificados e caros que ele s conseguiu por ter dinheiro para pagar os melhores profissionais,4
15,Essa thread t um suco de chorume Parece que to no sub do ladoDito isso essa charge  uma merda e eu concordo que na prtica no muda muito  s que  meio desesperador um bilionrio s no um grupo como acontece comprar uma empresa do tamanho do twitter praticamente  fora No  algo novo mas  algo incomum o suficiente e que lembra o quo a merc dessa corja a maioria est,4
16,Se o Twitter ficar open source mesmo como ele disse ter sido uma puta mudana boaPode at forar a barra pra que outras empresas faam o mesmo Dessa forma a gente ia poder ver como o algoritmo funciona,5
17,Os comentrios to fedendo a paninho da punheta Calma ancapizada o deus de vocs ainda no comprou essa plataforma aqui no,4
18,Pra mim  o seguinteO Biden anunciou impostos para bilionrios no mesmo dia o Musk veio com free speech Pra no pagar mais impostos ele se vende pros Rupublicanos Foi a at por isso que ele anunciou que ia deixar a Califrnia pro Texas e a Tesla tambm Na prtica a fbrica na Califrnia teve expanso Engenheiros ainda esto na Califrnia mas a parte fiscal mudou pro Texas S pra pagar menos imposto,4
19,Fuck Elon Musk,4
20,Quantidade de gente passando pano pro Elon Musk nesses comentrios  algo sensacional viu,3
0,Please refrain from endorsing explanations rooted in identity politics or reductive gender essentialism such as wimmin b cryin,1
1,Sob This reminds me of the time when Voldemort took control of the Ministry of Magic,825
2,Absolutely normal behavior,378
3,Elon is probably gonna have to clean house when he gets ownership This staff seems like theyre destined for the looney bin,252
4,She sounds like a Star Trek Discovery character,223
5,has anything changed so far can I fedpost yet,203
6,What about the diversity officer and xer staff of 6 people Who will they bully into submission now,165
7,What does the median lib believe Elon is going to do Start the apocalypse right in Twitter HQ These peoples histrionics are nauseating and show how self centered they are on a daily basis The words free speech signify the the end of life as they know it Any language thats doesnt mirror what is sanctioned in a college safe space and I hate to use that analogy is too dangerous to be unregulated by the public at large I think weve found something worse than idpol  The libs rationale for powerElon Musk may be a terrible owner but Ive yet to see an evidencebased explanation for the reactions that tie to something he said or did Its bad enough you have the EU coming out to preemptively warn Elon while people like Hillary and Obama are ramping up their stop misinformation campaigns We never saw this antiMusk sentiment simply for him being a rapacious billionaire Ironically Elon Musk has become the current thing,137
8,lol Gravy train is over    Our cushy jobs wont disappear right away,114
9,For as much of a massive piece of shit musk is I have to say I still find this takeover amusing because even if I hate him I hate Twitter even more,96
10,,87
11,Yeah these reactions are just making me support Musks move more  Anodyne circa 2015 pro free speech noises bringing people to literal and I imagine sincere tears  Such people really shouldnt be in charge of such an important forum,75
12,Shes described as the moral authority of Twitter How does one persons morality dominate others within a corporation What resume line item makes you qualified to be a moral authority,69
13,I genuinely dont want Elon to fix twitter I want him to run it into the ground and take the financial loss I cant support Elon given  given his decidedly anti labor business practices Hopefully the debacle will result in a broader distribution of these type of social networks so that there are platforms that suit peoples various needs I think the biggest issue Ive had with sites like Twitter is that they end up being de facto monopolies due to behind the scene tech oligarchy shenanigans Take Parlor for example I dont think that site would have taken off since it didnt offer anything unique that people wanted other than  maybe a different user base and ToS However they were deplatformed by AWS for nonsense ToS violations Amazon should not be able to do this legally yet everyone waved it off as AWS is a private platform they can do whatever they want AWS is a private platform in name not in practice AWS hosts something like 33 of the internet AWS deplatforming someone is less like being kicked out of a private club and more like a business A buying up all the contracting firms in an entire region then telling those firms they arent allowed to build roadsbuildingsinfrastructure for any competitors to business A We see antitrust bs happen all the time between tech oligarchs you ever try to buy a Kindle book on an iPhone but the Parler incident was Amazon in kahoots with Twitter and the liberal establishment A common comeback is just build your own platform Howd that work out here Blue check frothers should be able to have their own space if they want the problem is that theres really only ONE space for discourse and they want to control it Thats easy to fix just open up the market once the monoliths fall,67
14,I honestly dont get why its seen as such a big deal Its interesting business news Musk seems like a tool to me  thats itIve seen Joe Rogan fanboys saying that hes going to save the world and Libs acting like its Berlin 1933I dont get why I should care,42
15,My thinking is if you rules were set and applied fairly you wouldnt be worried about someone coming in and interpreting them differently rightLIke if Musk shows up and says tell me about this rule they should be able to say here is where it comes form and heres where we applied it  and he should be able to see ok it makes sense and applies equally or it doesntThe problem is their politics is tied up with thier rules  Tech has that major issue of we hate racism  Oh but you cant be racist against white people    So now if the racism rule is applies equally they know a lot of them will start dropping like flies  Sexism is the same way  Insult men all day long but women are off limitsSexuality  LGBTQWPSW is of flimits but straights are fair gameSo it seems more like they are scared they will have to start living by the rules they made everyone else abide by,41
16,Crocodile Tears,31
17,Vijaya Gadde a key executive involved in decisions to remove former President Donald Trump huh i wonder who this isgoogle her namefirst picture is of her next to modilol,31
18,They inherently view free speech as a negative because they see it as antithetical to healthy speech which is just hierarchical levels of free speech based on historical marginalizationOf course theyll cry about it If speech is free for everybody and isnt a function of ones identity then their ideological apartheid falls appart Since so much of their strategy was based on creating the illusion that their ideas was the majority by silencing every dissension they know that leveling the field is an instant and automatic loss,30

9,In case you were wondering this is the hate speech the left is so afraid of seeing,19
10,I might have to actually use my twitter account more than the one single tweet I made to a game company because they wouldnt give me my product code,18
11,looking at the likes and retweets its clear that the people support these views however the previous owners of twitter did notthis is a very clear indication that the decisions were done by the few directly against the interests of the peoplethank God for Musk,15

11,Oh my god its happening everybody stay calm,10
12,Already seen atleast a couple of tweets from people threatening to move to canada if he buys twitter WTF These people are delusional and obviously have not a clue on how hard it is to immigrate to Canada,9

3,I have run out of popcorn because of all the shows going on as a result of it,12
4,How do these people even function in society They dont care about facts Trump has never done or said anything Racist But they ignore 45 year political career of Joe Bidens racism I have zero patience for these quacks Elon Musk donated hella lot more to charities than any democrat has last yearhellBiden still owes thousands in taxes,11

0,Here is the latest on his thoughts from the latest TED interviewhttpsyoutubecdZZpaB2kDMt708  Yes were aware this is not directly Tesla related but given this is a big event we thought it was worth discussing,1
1,Going to be interesting to see how this pans out,203
2,They couldnt find a better offerNow were about to find out what absolute free speech means to the guy with many things on his mind,167
3,Really not sure how this is good for anyone,151
4,Improve QC PR customer service at Tesla NahBuy Twitter for some odd reason 44 billion no questions,133
5,This is gonna either be a Shit show or absolutely amazing and Im so glad Im alive to see it Get the popcorn ready everyone ,109
6,How long before we have the twitter app in the car,73
7,Pros There is no such thing as bad publicityCons This will cause endless distractions and will probably end badly,58
8,Imagine 100 million being used to improve Tesla customer service Smh,39
9,And I bet the whole time Donald Trump probably thought man if only I had the money to do that,36
10,How the fuck do you run correctly a giant car company and now one of the bigger social media networks correctly Can the board please step in and ask him to completely step away from Tesla at this point and make a clean break I know he wont go peacefully but Does anyone actually think his heart has been into Tesla for a year or so now The cybertruck hype has floundered the roadster keeps getting pushed back the v11 software is pretty terrible  and the FSD hype is nothing like what your average user is experiencing with it Its time to make it official and bring someone in who cares only about Tesla not being king twitter troll,26
11,There was a recent interview with Musk when the Texas factory opened he said how every minute he spends thinking aboutworking on Tesla is super valuable for the company something like that  Isnt this Twitter thing a huge distraction and negative for Tesla overall,23
12,I dont like this deal  Tesla shareholders want Elon to be fully focused on Tesla Tesla and spaceX already consume all his time dont forget neurallinks and boring company Elon will be distracted away from tesla he is a human being and he also can sell Tesla stock to fund the operations which will push tesla stock down as when he did for taxes,14
13,Elon Tesla and Space X doesnt have a PR departmentAlso Elon,10
14,There goes the neighborhood,9
15,Is this why cost cutting via mobile chargers was implemented s except not really,7
16,Methinks Elon is about to find out what it feels like to burn through 44 billion for no reason,8
17,Borrowed 23 some on margin against his Tesla holdings Sorry what,8
18,Whatever our political differences I think we can all agree that were glad Elon Musk kept the 6bn he had offered to the UN World Food Program to end world hunger and instead used it to buy a social media website,9
19,Still waiting for the next social platform that doesnt have billionaire overlords Wont hold my breath,4
20,Musk is killing Tesla stock Tesla is down around 21 12 today since  April 4 when Musk first disclosed he had a position in Twitter You  cannot blame it on anything else to do with the companys sales GM production etc Musk IMO is a megalomaniac and Twitter under  Musk will become a platform to slime his critics bodyshame people defy securities laws and relentlessly hawk cryptocurrencies and the market does not like scary places,6

1,Yeah no shit Some guy who talks about planting brain implants in people is part of the NWO himself Im stunned that this sub is so excited about him buying Twitter,282
2,I did not take that tweet as him wanting to ID all twitter users Notice how he says Authenticate all real humans I take that as meaning authenticating that a real human is behind a certain account and not a bot If he wanted to ID all users then I feel like the tweet would have read and authenticate all individuals,118
3,digital ID,41
4,Bill Gates and Elon Musk are the same water carriers for the Rockefellers that JP Morgan wasSame way the Rockefellers carried the water for banking houses of Europe,36
5,Submission StatementWhen Elon Musk tweeted that he would authenticate all real humans he revealed his true purpose with the Twitter acquisition to remove anonymityAs Western governments become more totalitarian in nature it becomes increasingly important to have the option of anonymous communication One example is a citizen who wishes to criticize corrupt government without penalty After all we know the US Government is actively tracking the behavior of citizens online Yahoo Newshttpsnewsyahoocomthepostalserviceisrunningarunningacovertoperationsprogramthatmonitorsamericanssocialmediaposts160022919html New York Posthttpsnypostcom20210422uspsreportedlytrackingamericanssocialmediaposts Another example would be a doctor who wants to share his or her skepticism of new compulsory medical procedures in an era where doctors can lose their license for having a difference of opinion with the government See Section 1F herehttpsleginfolegislaturecagovfacesbillCompareClientxhtmlbillid202120220AB2098 as one exampleSo no this is not Elon Musk coming to the rescue to bring free speech to the world Rather this WEF young global leader is taking a step toward a unified digital ID system Remember the Elon Musk tweet making fun of Bill Gateshttpstwittercomelonmuskstatus1517707521343082496 That was to trick us so we wouldnt realize his current action is a move toward Gatess ID2020 initiativehttpsid2020orgStay skeptical Real heroes dont have that kind of wealth and power in this world,31
6,Nothing changedYou should use all online services as if everything is recorded and tied to you personally already Be carefull Privacy online is hard already,23
7,I literally just came to post this Say goodbye to your anonymized accounts Sock puppets will be banned as bots Good way to control speech and chill criticism of powerful people,26
8,It looks like he wants to do two things 1 Eliminate bots that falsely amplify certain opinions 2 Give people the opportunity to have their accounts verified in their own names Basically give anyone a blue check if they confirm their identity Its possible he wants to also rid the site of anonymous accounts but nothing hes said so far leads me to that conclusion,18
9,If you still think anonymity exists on Twitter youre in for a disappointing ride,13
10,Reddit is next,4
11,If Twitter wanted to eliminate anonymity they would do it They dont need Musk to buy it in order to justify it,5
12,He will remove anonymity and also ban anyone who speaks out against the West aiding the Ukraine  They want to turn Twitter into Reddit,3
13,What Dude all it means is less bots What kind of shit propaganda is this,3
14,Yup This guy gets it,4
15,There are no heroes,3
16,Best way to find his critics or help out China,1
17,Thats not the takeaway I got from reading that although I see why one would assume that based upon his wording To me it just seems like hes saying There are too many bots Ill get rid of those and ensure only actual humans are using the platform,2
18, Man is least himself when he talks in his own person Give him a mask and he will tell you the truth  Oscar WildeBut those who rule us dont want people to be able to tell the truth,2
19,As a robot I am highly offended by this post,2
20,Musk is a Young Global Leader Schwab announces that cleaning the internet of misinformation and taking control of it was next on his agendaMusk convinces everyone he is not the same as the other eliteMusk buys TwitterI dont think he is the savior people think he is,3

3,Elon musk is african american of the year,63
4,What a garbage take,61
5,This shit is so tired  Literally everything is white supremacy far right right wing blah blah blah They need to find a new schtick,37
6,Oh yes from the white guy who pretends to be black What a winner,36
7,Even if that were true Elon experienced what happened to the country when Mandela and his corrupt party took over South Africa went from a first world to a third world country,20
8,Like people of other colors dont target white people to harass them You can verbally abuse the hell out of write people on Twitter,13
9,Martin Luther cream,12
10,Watching the twitterati cry and scream that Elon Musk buying twitter will start ww3 was great,10
11,A white man pretending to be black who is telling black people what to think Now thats white power,11
12,Yes Censorship is quite possibly the most American thing we can engage in  Freedom simply tastes better when only some of us have it  To think otherwise is completely white supremacist Because if there is one thing that white supremacists stand for it is for all people to have equal access to free communication  Ugh  So disgusting  We simply cannot tolerate this kind of tolerance of freedom,8
13,Imagine living in a fantasy realm 247 and you cant escape,8
14,Im not a fan of Elon Musk but this is a dumb take,7
15,He is legitimately AfricanAmerican so theres that,7
16,Idk why he would buy that company At least Reddit has lots of porn,7

18,This just in White guy that thinks he is black hates successful African,8
19,Shaun could be the next Steve Harvey making such a bad take so funny takes skill,6
20,Shaun would know,6
0,The way he rushed to give that interview calling gme investors gamblers is proof enough for me that he is exposed badly but I think his divorce was really caused by his relationship with Epstein  theguardiancomtechnology2021may10melindabillgatesdivorcejeffreyepsteinmeetings,168
1,He has lots of money to put somewhere and has allocated a bunch of it to US farmland for obvious reasons they aint making more of it and it aint going down in value Its that simple IMHOOn GME he is anti bitcoin and anti GME because hes a traditional  investor who understand startups and therefor sees these as FOMO things so should have stayed away like his buddy Warren Buffett but since he thinks hes smarter than literally everybody he couldnt restrain himself and went short on both TLDR Hes working for himself not for retail and he will be fucked on a percentage of his holdings if MOASS becomes a thing,104
2,Cnbc cut that video on YouTube Gates was asked by Andrew are you short Gamestop,42
3,He didnt shill GME holders Hes been VERY vocally opposed to GME and the rest Im beginning to think you dont know what shilling means,41
4,Is short Tesla not was And thats precisely why Elon roasted him nothing to do with GME even if Gates is also short GME,19
5,Spicy Thats for bringing this to light His body language is very interesting for someone that isnt involved He is very nervously fidgety and also very defensive of hedge funds,11
6,why would you say assuming bill is definitly short on GME,8
7,Bill lost all credibility to me  Hes a degenerate gambler pretending we shouldnt play  Fuck you Bill,8
8,My guy your post is essentially 2 long ass runon sentences Painful to read,7
9,I only came here to say fuck bill gates and his diabolical plans Why he buying up all the farm land,2
10,Not exactly gme related but post related Because it seems so many people just want to gargle on Elons cock with no rational thinking or having a larger discussion of how useless the guy is Im sorry but there is a lot of chatter currently especially on twatter with how Car Company is working towards tackling climate change Is it really though If you have a Tsla in Russia or the USChina India or countless other countries is your electricity coming predominantly from clean energy sources If not then all you are doing is shifting pollution from one area to another Working towards tackling climate change does not come from only replacing combustible engines with an electronic engine it comes from reducing the necessity to using a car for the most mundane uses Improving rail travel public transportation and in countries where viable improving access to and the ease of use for bikingjust to name a few things that actually tackle pollution and improvement of wellbeing and air quality within citiesSo Elon may not like shorts but he is just a selfloving business man who only cares about promoting his own agenda Not to mention he will be paid around 23 billion or so through stock which is insane to think for one man to be paid as salary in one year How will he use that to tackle climate change,1

18,I dont pay attention to either of these jokersWhen things drop theyre gonna be small fish,1
19,There was rumors Bill Gates created covid maybe he did and maybe it was to create fear or I mean maybe coronavirus was even a hoax by powerful people to scare people into doing things to control the markets I mean getting everyone to stay home your effectively creating less demand for certain things and more demand for others Like fuel is in less demand and toilet paper is in high demandcould you not short a bunch of retail and create fear in people so they stay home and dont shop essentially closing up retail and making a bunch of money on the shorts You sure can if you have a bunch of money and the governments at your pocketEDIT I forgot to mention that we know they all control the media so spreading any disinformation is crazy easy for them,-1

1,Job Creators,33
2,another billionaire creating jobs I mean profit for shareholdersSo cutting jobs Thats what they do,29
3,Job cuts isnt a way to make money its a way to increase profits provided revenue is constant Its not a meaningless distinction,23
4,same story for buying new company,20
5,In my opinion the Twitter board is hurting Twitter shareholders by selling the business to a man thats going to run it into the ground They have an obligation to maximize shareholder value That doesnt mean spike the price temporarily for a sale It means longterm growth Selling the company for a fair price now when the new owners business plan sounds bad is not maximizing shareholder value over any meaningful timespan,13
6,This is why I have a problem with him As much as I admire the direction hes taken Tesla and SpaceX both are profit driven by government contracts taxpayers money and tax rebates paid in by other car manufacturers who dont produce electric vehicles ie more tax payers money Without these both companies would eventually fail Hes managed to build up this cult of personality much like Steve Jobs where he can do no wrong and is operating on a higher level to us lesser mortals,8
7,Yes yes Job cuts The best way to make a company way less efficient so you can make more money Because thats how those things work just ask any company that did that,10
8,Guarantee you could fire 1015 of the Twitter workforce and there would be literally 0 reprecussions In fact things would probably run more efficiently if anything,6
9,Twitter is basically an overglorified forum with extreme running costs Not hard to fix twitter if you just settle for less aggressive engineering and product development and cut labor costs by 10x,5

6,Elon Musk is probably one of the strangest figures ever hes so divisive but actually does a lot of good one day hes the internets newest villain and the next hes the internets hero But regardless of personal opinions hes doing a lot of good in Ukraine,7
7,Im 5050 and hate to say it but according to Google age calculator if Im gonna be alive until 2082 Might as well be him for a bit while we can find other folks like him that arent as hardheaded and heatedIf Star TrekThe Expanse is anything to go by maybe the Vulcans will do their planet surveying early,2

0,The following submission statement was provided by uWallStreetDoesntBetThe experiment was dreamt up by Aleph Farms an Israeli company that specialises in growing meat from cells and is being carried out by the first allprivate astronaut team to visit the International Space StationSceptics though say the method is too unstable for astronauts to rely on  and that growing space meat will never be more simple than simply bringing it up from Earth Please reply to OPs comment here httpsoldredditcomrFuturologycommentsubacz0jeffbezosandelonmuskbothwanttocolonisei62vbql,1
1,Meat in the form of fish and other seafood is easier to do and the water can be used for growing plants as well A symbiotic relationship of fish and plants Protein from seafood plants provide veggies and greens for salads and balanced diet And water can be stripped for hydrogen to power fuel cells and of course the byproduct is oxygen molecules for atmosphere and fuels Much more feasible And self suffecient,91
2,Lets go to space  Alright where will I get my steak from,47
3,All this talk on multiple fronts about space colonization makes me wonder if we truly are immeasurably fucked from climate change and these people know it,19
4,I get that theyre doing science which is good But you dont need meat and it certainly isnt a requirement for space missions,16
5,The moon is covered in energy Space is full of natural resources Workers rights will def be limited in space,13
6,I mean people are meat  Once Bezos decides to up the price for your oxygen subscription you might need to auction off a family member,14
7,The experiment was dreamt up by Aleph Farms an Israeli company that specialises in growing meat from cells and is being carried out by the first allprivate astronaut team to visit the International Space StationSceptics though say the method is too unstable for astronauts to rely on  and that growing space meat will never be more simple than simply bringing it up from Earth,7
8,My other big idea use a captured asteroid to live in Hollow it out by mining the metals that make up most asterpids and seal the thing inside with spray foam to seal it tight Give it a spin to induce gravity maybe 3 or so maybe more and now you have a habitat Plus the metal in the part of asteroid left acts as a radiation shield and insulation from impacts Add some kind of fission or fusion drives to it and you have a colony ship Steering and other parts necesary for travel could be worked out Generation after generation until it reaches a habitable planet to colonize Or just use it as a space stationshipyard in space An orbiting way station Put it far enough out and once carbon nanotubes have actually been developed to a higher degree than now use it as a counter weight for space elevator,7
9,Im reasonably sure you can produce meat in lava tubes on mars assuming we can find some with ground penetrating radar Theory goes flyover satellites on mars until you find some tubes land and very carefully drill until you penetrate the tube check atmosphere and pressure in the tube if its got some pressure and the gas indicates existing life is unlikely excavate an easy access point Let the international science nerds study it for a year or so then boot them out and promptly sprayline the inside with a flexible membrane or if the pressure and atmosphere suggest mars quakes or interior human activity and water presence for thousands of years its a strong solvent isnt likely to be an issue of risk and if theres no living organisms leave the walls asis Install a great big solar or nuclear battery forced air filter  that works to collect dust and biological materials like skin cells hair  fur mould spores etc so you can keep the air quality ok given the lower gravity and also that can create buffeting winds internally now and then Pressurise the tube Warning That may take time and also having the infrastructure to repressurise it a few times also might take a couple of launches and some measure of onsurface or underground factoriesLevel out a floor and keep all the materials Make a bit of a quarry here and there and accumulate the minerals from the mars surface nearby that allows a precise measurement of earthsimilar soil that existing grass grows in Then mix your mars dirt making a few randomish variations and spread it out Oh wait Hills or ridges get you bigger surface area and promotes variations in vegetation probably important Now you need a whole lot of astronauts fruit veggies spicy mexican with beans and beer and some good live music maybe some dancing Collect all the human wastes and urine and food leftovers compost the lot then add it to your mars water Oh yeah dont forget that the mars water utility company has to have individual meters because some people live for their long shower and other people just smell bad Right so then plant some grass and spray it with your nutrient water accordingly having more of those science peeps doing tests on soil state depending on the human microbiome and what lives in the faeces I assume youre going to have martian grass in no time So then you need something with lots of stomachs that convert grass I propose very small cows that fit in the airlocks Or big but short ones Its going to be touch and go as they will be under carefully modified full spectrum lighting not a sun and again gravity but before too long you should have bovines that can leap fences better than the best kangaroosNow dont eat them and dont milk them either you sick puppies cows milk is for baby cows Milk your wife or husband or partner or SO instead Get some Hindus up there if you cant work out that the cows are sacred especially so when offearth Why cows You have the cows to help maintain turnover of the grasses and soil and feed the microbiome that aid in the rapid turning of dry soil into rich humus Also in case of genuine human medical emergency you do have animal products available and from a materials point of view you have something that produce methane which is useful as a greenhouse gas I guess In the rich humus you grow lentils or something Lots of herbs and spices and wildflowers on the hillsides etc Thats what you eat From then on its a strict one or two shits per week and no chilli Mexican or beer Dancing and music and sweating is still on though Time to get back to workAlso some rainforest would be useful but maybe do that in another nearby tube or do it after the cows are done and you have a reasonable amount of soil the cows can be moved to the next tube and the grass can go to rainforest Just no lawyer vines or mosquitoes please other human eating animals permittedNow if youre talking about growing animal cells in plastic trays or tubes or sponges in zero g in the dead cold vacuum of space in an inflatable space station or a collection of them or even trying to do precision fermentation in lightweight carbon fibre vats to create proteins or amino acids at scale you be my guest Its important to work that out for generation ships for interstellar travel but first we have to get a huge settlement on mars mining the ore to make the infrastructure and vessels to then mine the asteroid belt and other planets and moons in our solar system and make those generation ships But in the short term its far easier and more useful I think to focus on replicating as many earth environments as we can on other planets or moons in case earth has a wee problem of some sort that cant be avoided or addressed Also the more people we have travelling space when launching from places that have a lower escape velocity the sooner humankind can work out human safety in space Presently I would call it rather unsafe If you ask me earth has too damn big a gravity well to be of any real value building a presence in space unless we can work out nonchemical launches That reminds me big railguns Do particle accelerators have anything in common Do we have any copper ore left for one when we make 5 billion car sized EVs I dont recommend that btw more lightweight ebicycles pls And do you think the specs on that new xplane would help with projectile design if launching nonliving things Are the Russians happy to share their hypersonic projectile design if the xcrew is under US export rules and they cant sort out their paperwork Whats the biggest super capacitor weve made Do we have room temperature superconducting electrical transmission lines sorted yet or are we still spinning smoky magnets while high on caffeine and nitrous Or is it going to be a war of words between the catapult and trebuchet teams So many questionsPs anyone done a skylight in a cave before Lights use lots of electricity especially if youre growing things Im sure skylights are better but Ive worked in construction enough to know its difficult enough to make a building that doesnt leak water in or air out it might be too difficult in the beginning to have skylights in lava tubes but thats the goal Oh yeah Also can you do hypersonic travel on mars Maybe we need the railgun there so we can launch refined metals or spaceship parts into space for the bigger ships to go to other planets to help exploration there and for the onship space accomodation for people like a police force and community observers to make sure the exploration is fair dinkum and no more doing the dodgy as far as ignoring existing life and habitation goes,5

11,Nobody needs meat and keeping animals alive in space just to slaughter them is insanely stupid Growing Algae mushrooms and vegetables can be part of the filter and recycling process Investing resources in this absolutely unnecessary and evil endeavour is just simple and plain abhorrent and idiotic,4
12,Earth is the best planet for human existence in our solar system dont let Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk convince you otherwise Even after climate change takes its toll the worst day on Earth will beat the best day on Mars,2
13,not just that but what is the plan for shielding humanity is all about going to space but we dont have any plans for proper shielding from cosmic rays kind of a big deal since marss magnetic field isnt as strong as earths,2
14,Yeah meat can be grown in space but not out of moonrocks Gotta get some sort of ecosystem going for it to be sustainable,2
15,Calm down gentlemen I am sure space is big enough for everyone,2
16,Yeah you can grow spongy tissue from plants Remove the cells with chemicals to leave a scaffold Inject with cells from meat and nurture with a special solution for it to grow Recycling the solutions and chemicals will probably be the tricky part,2
17,You do NOT want to hit a space cow  With the velocities of objects in space it will lead to complete destruction of the cow and serious lifethreatening damage to your spacecraft at the minimum or you and the cow being converted to exclusive limited edition isotopes with extremely short half lives,2
18,We can grow the meat in labs well be fine Might not be to the extent of todays consumption but it will be doable,2
19,I think realistically people just wont eat animal products,2
20,Alternative question  Can we find new meats in space,2

1,These fools just announced theyre doubling down on state sponsored propaganda,185
2,The mask has totally come off of the federal government and the globalist western elite and their plans regarding the future of humanity This on a day when the FDA just approved Pfizer to start gene editing trials in the US The game is fully on People need to get ready,119
3,Ministry of truth,84
4,Boy did I call it or what  George Orwell,63
5,I have only one question When will the real Americans stand up and tell these traitors enough is enough,63
6,Impeach this asswipe already,37
7,They want to burn the Constitution,31
8,This should frighten everyone,26
9,This peoples are communists they want to create a dictatorship in this country ,22
10,Thats fine these asshats can prove their claims in court on a factual basis or get the pants sued off them,19
11,Its amazing how quickly the government can get things done and approve entire institutions when it helps them keep their power,16
12,Can someone say Government Overeach,13
13,The commies dont even try to hide what theyre really doing anymore,15
14,I hear these guys are good at spotting accurate information s,12
15,Disinformation goverence full of government morons,11
16,DOES THIS SCARE ANYONE YET WHAT WILL IT TAKE,11
17,How the fuck does anyone see this and think yes bravo this is exactly what we need I cant possibly reason for myself and need others to tell me when to eat shit sleep,10

19,Jeez I wonder which group of people will be disproportionately represented at the top levels of this  organization,8
20,Department of Truth  Who didnt see this coming,8
0,couple billion more to go right,163
1,no worries the tesla cult will buy the dipthis fuckin stock is hard to beat downx200Bbut damn if hes not done selling I hope he tells us when hes gonna sell his next batch so I can dump my entire life savings into TSLA puts,99
2,Tesla stock will continue to nose dive,59
3,Will he claim that he founded twitter,36
4,Who,23
5,Not a bad opportunity to buy the dip A lot of TSLA bulls are butthurt with Mr Musks antics but short term not a big deal  With the Tweeter uncertainty gone it might pop back up,13
6,I wonder how this benefits Tesla what does twitter do for Tesla It seems very irrational,6
7,That would explain some of the price action,3
8,How does one just sell 4 billion in a single day Who tf is buying all that,3
9,This thread is an interesting combination of people who obviously own Tesla and are desperately trying to convince themselves that Elon mass selling shares of Tesla to buy the biggest dumpster fire on the internet is somehow bullish for their holdings and then theres rational people who are just trying to figure out wtf is going on,2
10,Buy it up on discount TSLA is the way Buy and hold until at least 2030,2
11,Nice,1
12,Sell high buy low,1
13,Worst ADD ever,1
14,Whats missing here is HE JUST PUBLICLY STATED HE HAD A PRIVATE CONVERSATION ABOUT BILL GATED SHORT POSITIONHighly fucking suspicious Absolutely fucking ridiculous He literally publicized the convo to get in front of the fact that there were private communications about this but does it in a manner that makes him look like a great dudeHe single handedly saved Bill Gates position,1
15,With my 2020 hindsight I suppose we should have seen a sale coming with his decision to buy twitter  Maybe thats the reasoning behind Gates shorting Tesla,1
16,He actually sold 85 billion worth of Tesla shares,1
17,How do CEOs and other execs do this Do they just open their broker app and submit a limit order for millions of shares,1
18,Ok For noob here Why buy it ,1
19,Arent these scheduled anyways,0
20,I got a feeling tesla will hit 700 before end of next week,1
0,Not to change the subject its sort of related but whatever happened to reinstating net neutrality Didnt Uncle Joe say he supported that Is it another cornpop issue,316
1,Biden literally set up a ministry of truth under the guise of homeland security lol,218
2,It feels like Elon has ushered in a new more exciting future The old future was shitty full of bureaucracy and conformity The new future has some spirit and spunk in itWere in a meme future where the government is openly setting up an official propaganda department Live it,206
3,We are losing control of the narrative we must act nowSuddenly all the people who were cheering that Twitter is a private business they can do what they want are suddenly having huge changes of heart and now this little Twitter needs to be controlled,135
4, Nina Jankowicz will head The Department of Homeland Securitys Disinformation Governance Board as executive director Politico Playbook reported Wednesday morning Homeland Security Secretary Alejandor Mayorkas did not disclose any powers that would be granted to the dystopiansounding board while addressing lawmakers on Wednesday He explained that the board would work to tackle disinformation ahead of the November midterms particularly in Hispanic communities  But Mayorkas did say that the new board would come under the Bidenera Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships CP3 meaning it would have no powers to crack down on disinformation and will instead try to combat it by throwing money at what it sees as problems NGOs I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms what that would look like for the marginalized communities she said She said these groups are already shoulderingdisproportionate amounts of this abuse and said free speech and lack of censoring on social media would make it worse,101
5,Trust me the facts are what i say they are,63
6, The CP3 program provides communities with resources and tools to help prevent individuals from radicalizing to violence Last year CP3 awarded about 20 million in grants through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program It is unclear how much cash will be spent on the Disinformation Board The Ministry of Truth is another publicprivate partnership Who would have thought,50
7,This probably isnt the way to combat this but Americans brains being turned to mush by nonsense misinformation is a huge problem in my opinion I live in a deep red area and some of the shit i here from people is absolutely unbelievable Objective reality doesnt seem to change anything to these people This guy I work with died of covid and the majority of people i work with still dont think its real even his wife was posting on Facebook he died because they didnt give him ivermectin This is a dramatic example but I hear stuff in that vain daily Maybe its just because im saturated with it but its a huge issue in my personal life and only seems to be getting worse as time goee byI can understand a baseline skepticism of the government and shit but its gone way past that,43
8,The lady that is heading this new organization had an AMA 8 days ago redditcomrIAmAcommentsu7gf01imninajankowiczauthorofhowtobeawomanHeres one she did a year ago specifically about disinformation redditcomrIAmAcommentshvx52dimninajankowiczdisinformationfellowatthe,42
9,We all love Big Oneesama,29
10,So are we going to see government regulated speech in Biden term,25
11,Hate to be a libertarian on this issue but this woman is going to get hundreds of thousands if not millions of public tax dollars to undergo a political operation thats literally not gonna sway any noticeable  of votes The only people that give a fck about disinformation are the folks who would line up to vote rain or shine I get its already partisan hackery but its also intensely ineffective at that,26
12,why do they want a board to make disinformation,23
13,Russia expert,22
14,Liberals have basically totally given up on trying to have a good ideas and not look totally insane,21
15,Dawg Fam BRUHI know people are sick of 1984 comparisons but like what the fuck,13
16,httpswiczipediasubstackcompyoucantlockupthewholecountrySo she has considered as any good liberal the plusses and minuses of shutting down media companies as Zalinskiy does and offers that the US State Dept applauds this in some cases Hmmmm,10
17,At least they make it easy to see we shouldnt trust their fact checkers If they tried to hide their bias a little better we would be in trouble,8
18,Couple of years away from having a Department of Disinformation,7
19,The Ministry of Truth was never meant to be a reality,8
20,History Truth is written by the victors,7
0,Its true that some autistic people struggle with empathy but some autistic people have hyperempathy And theres a difference between being a sincerely kind person with a severe case of footinmouth syndrome and just being an asshole Elon Musk is not a sincerely kind personYou can be direct  blunt even  without being cruel,281
1,I would just go with I am autistic and I dont agree with your negative view of autism so please dont bring it up with me again and leave it at thatAutistic men not only autism but a lot of things tbh get all these passes for bad behavior and using autism as an excuse and I wish it would end When you would normally call that behavior being a jerk its suddenly ok Whereas women are held to a much higher standard and even just being direct not even rude is unacceptable regardless of if you are ND which is why we mask so much moreSome people are just shitty both NT and ND Theres a ton of diagnosed people who dont treat people that way so obviously its not something intrinsic about autism But people are ignorant and a lot of people who like Elon get VERY aggressive if you say anything negative about him They wont change their mind and I wouldnt bother personally,167
2,Oh man We had a mentally unstable incel following and threatening women in university When I met a counselor to discuss he told me that the student just naively doesnt understand social cues with women and to understand that hes on the spectrum This was a guy who made jokes about strangling women  My reaction was to stare blankly and say Im autistic too I tried explaining to the man that there is actually line of malicious intent we see,119
3,If anything I feel like I have TOO MUCH empathy because of my autism Im so conflictadverse and I cant ever take things at face value without wondering if Im maybe possibly hurting someone in some vague way It makes life difficult when you obsessively empathize with everyone and everything ,85
4,I was worried about people saying this exact type of thing when Musk revealed that he was autistic Oh no wonder hes such a dick No autism does not make you a dick never being called on your mistakes does,70
5,I would counter hes a villain because his family owns a diamond mine too rich to have any connectionempathy to people,48
6,Honestly Im kind of offended Musk claims to just be autistic He gives me narcissistic sociopath vibes,43
7,I had a convo about him with my fiances friend last night Fiances friend was trying more to defend him bc all hed seen was people say that he was an autistic asshole So on one had thats a bit nice that he was like hey dont just hate someone bc theyre autisticuse it as an insult But on the other hand I was like no no lets talk about why hes terrible for actual reasons For me his treatment of his first wife was horrific  Autism isnt a pass to be abusive,37
8,He said he was willing to spend 6bn to solve world hunger  Some organizations actually took him seriously and drafted a plan  Now no talk about solving world hunger and 54bn to buy Twitter  Hm  Autistic people have a strong sense of justice  He doesnt make sense to meFor the discussion with your coworker an easy counter example is Greta Thunberg,38
9,Remember when it seemed like people were trying to claim that every school shooter was autistic People like to ascribe reasons for people being different and nuerodivergency is broad enough and misunderstood enough that its a convenient catchallAs for your coworker it might help to start coming up with famous autistic people who are not assholes Otherwise leave it with only 3 people you need to suck things up much more than in a larger company and this isnt worth screwing yourself over,29
10,Ugh I had coworkers say the same thing after the SNL special I just cant with rocket car man Hes such a spoiled child imo,23
11,I dont struggle with empathy at all I struggle with sympathy,18
12,you can be autistic AND a narcissistic ahole,15
13,Autism does not cause racism sexism or any other form of douchebaggery,14
14,Ive found that by telling someone like that Im autistic they start backpedaling really fast if Im friendly with them They realize that their prejudice is incorrect,10
15,I dont understand why people who happily drive Teslas have so much of a problem with the owner of that company owning a social media platform that not very many people actually use This entire story does not compute for me The majority stakeholder of pretty much every large company in the US is either Blackrock or Vanguard or both Twitter and Tesla included None of these people care about what Blackrock is doing worldwide but they have the energy to care about who owns Twitter,6
16,Honestly Elon Musk is a cult leader like glorified dick but blaming his behaviour on autism is just dumbThe person who told you this is an uneducated one Also if they know you have ASD and still said it theyre an asshole,6
17,How exactly is he bad,5
18,Lol one of my old coworkers would always complain to me about how we were being treated differently by management which was correct but couldnt understand why it was that my  openly autistic and very direct  boss seemed to not pick up on hints and didnt like eye contact Like hmmmm idk sounds like a real challenge to work with someone who wont accommodate the most basic of things babe,6
19,Good on you for holding them accountable Confrontation is fucking hard but also can be beautiful You dont owe them shit and dont need to reveal your diagnosis unless you want to The men Ive met like that just WISH they were Elon MuskWhat was the intention of his statement anyway The fuck is he trying to prove How he could be an Elon Musk if he didnt care about people then why is he shitting on a person to prove it,6
20,Id have probably lit that person up like the proverbial Christmas tree  I have lit idiots like up in my day I should mention that I have utterly no qualms about such Heck I even had to literally spell out the word autistic ,4
0,When did the Nazis and Fascists care about freedom of speech tho,223
1,brags about free speechbrags about users being banned for opposing your views,160
2,Every single free speech absolutist on mainstream social media is a hypocrite If they actually thought that no moderation was better theyd use 4chan The fact that any of these people use social media that relies on moderation is an inherent admission on their part that they do not actually want freespeech absolutism,110
3,PCM memes make me feel even more mentally ill than I already am,57
4,Famous free speech activists  authoritarian right,46
5,God theyre such fucking hypocrites How the fuck does 1 person buying Twitter make it better for free speech and not worse Oh no the various boards of people who run Twitter decide on what we can or cant say on their platform thats so unfair I know lets allow one person to decide instead Its literally reverse logic,42
6,Elon Musk free speech be like no prounion or anticorporations sentiment guys Im pro free speech trust me bro,36
7,Twitter has free speech but also no freedom of consequence,19
8,The First Amendment literally has nothing to do with it Why are conservatives so fucking stupid If Elon wants even a prayer of maintaining profit hell definitely keep the ban hammers Ergo dipshit libertarians are still going to be wrong but theyll pretend like they won because free speech just means whatever righties feel like in the moment,16
9,I love how they dont understand the definition of Free Speech in America eitherFor any PCMtards reading free speech does not mean say whatever the hell you wantFreedom of speech protects you from the United States government suppressing your opinion of the country and etcElon Musk is going to turn Twitter into how HE wants so yes he is basically going to be a dictator of Twitter,10
10,Have any of them read the first amendment It says the government cant pass laws that restrict free speech,9
11,Key thing to note He hasnt bought twitter yet The board has agreed to present his offer to the shareholders and they have the final say on whether they accept or not,6
12,Rightoids when the elite controls speech platforms but they agree with it now,4
13,shit is gonna pull a tumbler and crash is my guess,2
14,Is people reacting and holding them accountable for whatever garbage they spew not also free speech What ami saying Theyre fascists,2
15,Since when is china auth left Wtf,1
16,People know that one of the largest shareholders before this was a Saudi Prince Talal right Right,1

0,Musk is certainly a troll and dips into internet culture quite a bit so hes very controversial But overall I think hes a strong force for good His companies are mostly awesome Tesla SpaceX Starlink Boring Company is probably not that realistic and Im not certain what will happen with Twitter but I hope for the best Hes a little crazy but Id expect as much from someone who takes such risks Not a fangirl these are just my thoughts on him,73
1,Hes not wrongThe US is a net positive on the world most others are at best neutral or even a detriment germany belgium,62
2,He says he likes America yet the Tesla headquarters in not in Detroit Curious,57
3,ive been saying this from the start elon is peak american,39
4,I see i still avoid worshipping anyone in his case because he has a presentation room in Xinxiang,35
5,Using child workers is unamerican,24
6,Least patriotic immigrant,25
7,hopefully with his views on free speech that he does not make it easier for russian disinformation to spread on twitter,17
8,Elon Musk is a disgusting person dont fall for his blatant attempts at pandering,9
9,Bootlicking Xi Jinping is absolutely based american This guy is just a dirty billionaire like the others but he cares about his public image enough,8
10,musk said the CCP made a better future for Chinese,7
11,Based af long live musk man saving the earth,3
12,Yea i mean for people to point at countries infinitely smaller and homogenous and say look they are doing it better Is just silly First theres a handful We all know the names Second they are only able to maintain it BECAUSE of the rules the USA has set Border disputes and territory wars dont exist mostly anymore because of the USA The idealist countries in northern europe the left loves to point at are possible only by US intervention peace and prosperity Think of every great empire thats ever existed was there ever ONE that wasnt constantly growing its boarders stealing resources fighting territory wars imposing its values The US had its growth phase in the last two centuries and instead of continuing its imperialism which was arguably not even imperialism and never even having a colonial phase we look to protect other sovereign nations We look to empower smaller nations with safe banking and economic mobility we have mostly open boarders and a mostly meritocratic society Maybe im biased because im the child of immigrants but to me the US is a CLEAR 1 We may not have the best healthcare or schools But countries like Netherlands and Japan do because of US,1
13,I dont really have a positive light on elon but kinda based doe ,1

0,A few things to note The article referenced can be found here nationalreviewcomnewspsakisaysbidenconcernedaboutsocialmediaplatformspowerafterelonmuskacquirestwitteramp  The most important information can be found in the video inside the article  A better more comprehensive explanation then what I could provide of why this is so concerning is linked in the titlehttpsodyseecomAlphaNerd8elonmuskbuystwitterfrCdde2Szy4mmyNWq3Q9SFW9hCGAh2XsXjt37 Hinted reforms would make PLATFORMS liable for what their users say  This would mean if a user posted say libel on a website that site would be forced to remove it effectively forcing all sites to censor content  Quite convenient this happens immediately following Elons acquisition its almost like they want to target sites they dont like I use the word desire in the title because that is all it is  A desire  No revisions have YET to be proposed however the above is still extremely significant as Psaki is Bidens secretary AND secretary of White House press meaning that she is speaking on behalf of a significant and influential percentage of the government  Even if changes never come IT IS BEYOND CONCERNING THAT ANYONE LET ALONE A LARGE CHUNK OF GOVERNMEN EVEN PROPOSED SUCH A THING Finally Odysee the platform the linked video redirects you to is a decentralized free speech alternative to YouTube  Anyone who cares about the 1st amendment should definitely check out the sitehttpsodyseecominviteCdde2Szy4mmyNWq3Q9SFW9hCGAh2XsXj,49
1,The government is headed for striking down the first amendment in any meaningful way besides actual And liberals are cheering for it,50
2,Id rather The fed be ended but thats just me,41
3,Imagine triggering bluetards and all you did was say you prefer free speech  What a bunch of fucking losers,37
4,,21
5,I would be extremely tentatively supportive of a reform to section 230 If it was sponsored directly by Rand Paul Justin Amash and directly supported by the Libertarian Party I would happily hear it out and see if it was going to maximize liberty without just being a way to give government control over social media Its an issue Im not sold on but Id be willing to hear out their proposalIf its being pushed by the politicians who only seemed to care about the problems with social media the moment it was even hinted that it might not be wildly biased towards their side Im going to remain firmly opposed Because its very clear that theyre worried about losing control not about freedom,22
6, httpsiimgurcomaz2RT7Mjpg,4
7,Werent there tons of libs out there saying Sec 230 had nothing to do with censoring content on social media platforms Theyre mysteriously quiet now,3

1,Its concerning to me how many changes are happening so fast to the algorithm whats allowed and whats not over night and whats trending Its like they were waiting for musk to buy twitter in political theatre  to open the floodgates of outrageous shit people want censoredI bet all shit will hit the fan when Musk allows Trump back on twitter This will become very political quickly,72
2,Heres a thread on Blackrock incase you dont know what it is httpstwittercomcrabcrawler1status1518312809230368768,36
3,On the subject of Blackrock buying homes by the 10s of thousandsWe really need cascading tax regulations on corporate and household residential property ownership We need to make it financially impractical for companies to use home ownership as a safe haven for liquid Its one thing if a company is building homes then selling them A company like Blackrock buying hundreds of thousands of homes is no benefit to the middle class it just makes the rich even richer Nothing wrong with a household that has a handful of houses We run into the same issues with houses when a household owns 3 dozen homes Housing isnt like other commodities Its a necessity to live in most parts of the USThe rich and corporations owning so many homes just forces the middle class into a position where they need to rent to survive This ends up with them hemmorging money monthly with no long term equity and it only benefits the rich Just another way the middle class is having their money funneled up to the richReal estate is a fucking cheat code for the rich now Use existing liquid to buy property outright hire management company to deal with renters collect free money every month while also keeping all the equity,23
4,You realize he hasnt actually taken over yet right Shareholders still need to approve the deal and the process will take some time,13
5,This gives me hope,11
6,It has trended before Theres definitely a different vibe to twitter but Ive seen blackrock and vanguard before as well,5
7,The beginning of the rug pull Theyre going to flood the system with all the outrageous shit theyve been suppressing and the normies are going to lose their shit,5
8,Ive seen Blackrock trend multiple times in the past year or soMusk isnt involved with any Twitter policieschanges yet These types of acquisitions can take months to kick in,3
9,From what Ive seen with plenty of peoples accounts being reinstated out of the blue and interactions increasing on people who were shadow banned indicates alot of the problems did not come from the algorithm and moreso actual humans blocking and throttling accounts This just has started happening after Twitter accepted musks offer And even if it is the algorithm its being rapidly corrected internally which would mean at some point variables were added whatever those variable be and now they are being rolled back Its quite interesting with the idea of Twitter algorithm becoming open source potentially it would seem evidence of malfeasance is being destroyed or covered up I just imagine Twitter right now as the episode of SpongeBob where his brain is trying to find a name but they threw it out so the entire place is on fire,4
10,Everyone realizes that Musk is not at the helm yet right He didnt buy a used Kia and drive it off the lot its going to take weeks to months for the deal to finalize and it could fail to go through at any point,3
11,Blackrock is one of the largest owners of Twitter Elon is buying all of them out,2
